As many of you know, I've been working as a QA on the team for quite some time, on projects like Tombs of Amascut. I wouldn't be where I am today without that team - they work exceptionally hard! Moving over to the design team has made for an incredible couple of months so far, and I've had a blast constructing this event for you all. Christmas events are so iconic for Old School and to be able to make one is simply amazing! I went to the extra effort of giving some of the characters their own lore too. I hope Mod Ed will be proud. Spacebarring not allowed!\n\nWhile I'm here, I'd love to give a quick shout out to the Art team. They have done a stellar job not only with the rewards but with a brilliant new environment. They never miss!\n\nI can't wait to be a part of some REALLY awesome projects coming next year.

    "2": "Before we carry on, we'd like to exit 'blog mode' temporarily to get a little more personal. To say that designing Old School's first new Prayer book is 'a bit of a daunting task' would be an understatement. Some of our players are extremely nostalgic for Ancient Curses, some loved Curses generally but disliked some specifics (we didn't want to name names, but it's Soul Split), some want to see the Ruinous Powers outperform the Prayers we already have, others want there to be balance - in short, there's a lot going on here. With more players getting stuck in to PvM every year, changes to prayers have the potential to impact huge swathes of content.\n\nWe'd like to think that what we're proposing impacts that content positively. Thanks to your collective creativity and fantastic suggestions, we've been able to select a whole host of prayers that are interesting in their own right but most importantly come together in a set that we believe is cohesive and exciting without being overpowered. Swapping 'Protect from X' out for Dampen and Absorb prayers that we've seen crop up in multiple suggestions sets the stage for the Ruinous Powers to sacrifice your longevity and endurance to gain access to power that - when used well - should just feel good.\n\nOfferings like Gambit or Vindication afford veteran players the opportunity to maximise their damage by interacting with offensive prayers in a new way while providing new avenues for others to improve and hone their abilities. Conversely, Trinitas, Metabolise and Rejuvenation are extremely simple to benefit from and give those of us who aren't exceptional players a reason to use the book. The lack of defensive bonuses or Defence requirements gives some builds better opportunities to 'punch up' in PvP while increasing their own risk (as well as their Combat level) in fast-paced fights, or on the total opposite end of the action we've incorporated suggestions to benefit a more relaxed playstyle in the form of Conservation, Ancient Abundance and Ancient Offering.\n\nWe really hope you like what we've put together, and that you're able to look through the list of prayers and think about how you might be able to put them to use. We're excited (and perhaps a little anxious) to see what all of you think!\n\n- The Old School Team",
