It is not possible to fail slashing a web if that web is on the correct path.\n* Pray ranged all the way until checkpoint 5. You will be attacked by both melee and ranged, but due to distance, melee attacks are less frequent.\n* There are several spots where you will stand between climbable rocks and a web. These can be treated as safespots if you ever need to take a rest.\n* If you run into a rock or a web which you're unable to break or cut through, and you get a game message in chat containing something like '...Maybe find another route.', you will have to try another route.\n* Make your way east until you find a crossroads going south or north.\n** It is recommended players try the southern route first. If the web cannot be slashed, the player must move to the northern path.\n*** After successfully slashing the web and walking through, right-click to unlock one of the chests; if it opens, search it for a combat scratched key, and if it doesn't, unlock and search the other chest.\n*** Continue east and then north until the two paths meet up again.\n** If the southern web is not slashable, go back up the rocks and head north. This path will lead to another room with similar chests.\n*** Right-click to unlock one of the chests; if it opens, search it for a combat damaged key, and if it doesn't, unlock and search the other chest.\n*** Continue through to the north-east to meet up with the other path.\n* After meeting up with the alternative route, continue further north and pass through the door matching the key you obtained (see the map for each door's location).\n* You will now pass some traps. The traps that are on the 'correct' route for the player (as indicated by their key) can be disarmed by the player, and will shoot darts significantly less. The traps on the wrong route will always fire when passing them.\n** The floor blade trap can be avoided with proper timing, but getting hit by them will hit relatively low damage compared to the damage done by the monkeys.\n** Do not bother disarming the dart traps, as these only seem to fire if the player takes the wrong route, or stands still in their line of sight for several seconds. If these do shoot you, they may inflict poison starting at 8 damage.\n** The spinning blade can be disarmed, or you can simply run past taking a small amount of damage. However, do NOT run past if you do not have the \"combat scratched key\", since that will cause you to get stuck, forcing you to teleport out.\n* Open the door for your key as indicated on the map, and continue west to meet up with the agility route."

A \"pop\" sound and the valves resetting does not mean you've lost the barrel of coal tar; simply restart from the beginning of the steps without exiting the interface. The process is fast and may use only 4-5 coal. If you forgot or ran out of coal, you can leave and come back.\n* Once the green bar is full you may exit out of the interface and automatically receive the barrel of naphtha\n* Make a second barrel of naphtha for Mourning's End Part I. No sulphur or quicklime needed to be added to the second barrel.\n*Use the pot of quicklime and ground sulphur on the barrel of naphtha to make a barrel bomb (unfused).\n*Use the strip of cloth on the barrel bomb (unfused) to make a barrel bomb."

If they ask for another type of ore, just click on the secretary again without accepting. Repeat this until they ask for the type of ore you are carrying (this will often take longer than just making trips to retrieve whatever is asked)\n* A hidden scoring system determines your progress with a company; each ore delivery completed gives 20 points, while failing or refusing a task subtracts 2 points. Once you reach 75 points, you can deliver metal bars for the director for 12 points each; 100 points is required to progress through this section.\n**Note: Don't refuse tasks, if you don't like the task click on the secretary again for a new task before closing the dialogue. Refusing too many tasks will gradually reduce the hidden score and you will have to do more tasks to make up for it.\n** Players who join The Purple Pewter can get a head start of 20 points if speaking to the Purple Pewter Secretary whilst wearing a full set of H.A.M. robes.\n*Talk to the director after making enough progress and complete a few tasks for them. \n**Note: The directors require you to retrieve bars (cannot be noted).

It is highly recommended to bring Saradomin brews or anglerfish to heal above 100% health prior to the attack landing to avoid being killed.\n*After defeating the Fragment of Seren, Baxtorian will invite you into Prifddinas.\n*Congratulations, quest complete!"

Read the note.\n* Go south of Mount Quidamortem (Xeric's Honour teleport) or west of fairy ring (BLS) to the boat dock to the west. Drink the strange potion and board to get to The Stranglewood.\n* Beware that The Stranglewood is full of high level (combat 138, 149) strangled who will root you and deal continual damage.\n* Follow the path south, enter the city, and talk to Kasonde after the cutscene.\n* Go down the entry and defend Kasonde from the strangled for three minutes by building barricades, detonating satchels, and attacking them. Failing will simply start the activity over.\n** Around the area are 6 stone chests. 4 need to be picked. They contain 2 barricades and 4 satchels with explosives.\n** To pick the chests is to just click confirm, see if any show up as green on the right, and if not, move everything up by one.\n** The first wave will come from the south, so build the barricade there.\n** You can attack over the barricade with Magic.\n** Always prioritise the strangled attacking Kasonde.\n* Go upstairs and talk to Kasonde.\n* Gather korbal herb and argian berries.\n** Run directly north, head west past the (south side of) large pyramid, then north again. The korbal herb is located on a small outcrop with a boar.\n** The argian berries are found at the south-west beach with a lynx. Run south from the boar, west once you hit a wall, then south across a bridge. Cross the bridge and run directly south until you see a lynx. The argian bush is in the camp south-west of the old campfire. \n* Travel to the largest pyramid at the north end of the city.\n* Enter the pyramid and fight the strangled attacking Kasonde.\n* Talk to Kasonde.\n* Use the korbal herb and then the Argian berries on the unfinished serum.\n* Drink the strangler serum; the strangled will no longer root you, nor will you gain infection and be forced to restart. However, you will still take normal damage from them.\n* Gear to fight Vardorvis, who is located in the north west snowy square. The first time you go, you need to run back down south-west across the bridge, west, and around the long way. After entering the lair once you can start to use a shortcut by going down the entry in the north-west, near where the herb was found, and then running west to the square. Vardorvis is weak against slash and weapons such as scythe of Vitur and abyssal tentacle work well.\n* After you've entered his area you unlock a shortcut near the boat to get back. It's the path north of the temple. You do not need to complete the boss battle to unlock this shortcut.\n** The boss hits with Melee and the arena spawns axes which must be dodged or else they inflict a bleed damage.\n** There is a blue dart that is shot at you which disables Prayer for a few ticks. Pray Protect from Missiles to prevent the effect. You have time to get your Protect from Melee back up before the boss starts attacking again.\n** The boss also roots you and small blood splats appear on the screen. Click them all to not take 30+ damage from the root. It can be helpful to eat before or after clearing this special to avoid losing DPS ticks to eat delay.\n** An easy way to get past this boss is by purposely standing in a quadrant and accepting the axes that hit you. It's significantly less damage than running around misreading. The axes do sub 20 damage and the bleed only ticks for 2 dmg when you attack/move. Keep movement to a minimum and only dodge the floor spikes (1–2 tiles).\n* After defeating Vardorvis, pick up the temple key and bring it back to Kasonde in the Temple. Be aware that you are about to fight another boss.\n* Kasonde will attack you. Dodge his explosions and poison splats.\n** Pray Protect from Missiles and kite while attacking with Ranged. Crossbow with diamond bolts (e) works well.\n** The green splats will venom you, bring anti venom of some sort.\n** Stepping on orange splats will damage you around 15 Hitpoints and disable protection Prayers.\n** He will do a charge attack, have one of the pillars block line of sight to avoid damage.\n** He will continue to heal as you fight. The only way to kill him is to out dps his healing. Ironmen using melee will find a dragon dagger useful. When his health is low, use the dragon dagger special attack. Strangely, a Zamorakian Hasta special attack clears all liquid on the floor left from vials. \n** The bow of Faerdhinen with crystal armour is very effective for the fight.\n* After defeating him talk to him to find out where the medallion is, then proceed to the next room and search the stone chest for a tatty page.\n* Return to the hideout with the barricade and search the stone chest in the north-east corner to obtain Vardorvis' medallion. \n* Take the medallion to the Ancient Vault north-east of Nardah and use it on Vardorvis' statue in the north-east corner."

In addition, a slayer helmet or facemask are required for the second and third passages. During your third scar, you will take minimal periodic choking damage, do not AFK for extended periods outside of the puzzles (This damage does not occur in either finished or unfinished puzzles).\n* Throughout The Scar you will find chests with scarred scraps.

      "* Prepare to fight Duke Sucellus. You can go to a bank and return safely.\n* Enter the Dragonstone Gate, in the very far north-east section of the prison (NOT IN ADMINISTRATION AREA).\n* Once inside the Asylum, Duke Sucellus' chamber is located directly north of you but the Duke himself is asleep. On the sides there are extremities that periodically open their eyes, their gaze emitting a red cone. You will need to run past the extremities while also avoiding stunning energy attacks emitting from the floor indicated by a shadow: If hit by the extremities, you will take large amounts of damage..\n* Once past the extremities, there are arder and musca mushrooms, one on each site. 80+ Herblore: Pick 2 of each mushroom and use a pestle & mortar on them, under 80 herblore: pick 3 of each; afterwards make your way to the centre of the room where there are two barrels you must deposit the grounded mushrooms into. On the sides of the arena, near the middle pillars are salt deposits which you must mine: You need 12 parts of salt and each mushroom dust to fill the two barrels and obtain two Arder-musca poisons.\n* When you have the two poisons, drink your potions and activate Piety and use the poisons on Duke Sucellus which will begin the fight. Sucellus has several attacks, most of which deal a lot of damage if they hit you:\n** Sucellus slams his arms on the floor, summoning spikes of ice on every tile directly adjacent to him. The spikes deal 0-12 chip damage, but Sucellus' melee hits can deal upwards of 30.\n** If you're not within melee reach, Sucellus will fire a blue magic orb that can hit through Protect from Magic, though with reduced damage. \n** Sucellus spits out acid clouds, which can deal rapid damage upwards of 10 every game tick. As soon as you see him spit the acid, run to the pillar on the other side of the room while avoiding standing on any tile that's directly adjacent to Sucellus.\n** Every 6 attacks Sucellus opens his eye and unleashes his gaze upon you: Hide behind one of the pillars closest to you as soon as this happens or the attack will deal 90+ damage.\n* Sucellus is weak to demonbane weapons and his spike attack deals less damage than his Magic so Arclight is an ideal weapon to dispose of him. An easy way to defeat Sucellus is to equip as much Strength-boosting gear as possible and stand directly behind one of the two pillars closest to him. Every time Sucellus uses his ground slam attack, as soon as his arms hit the ground hit him and immediately run back behind the pillar, as if you were flinching him: You will take chip damage from the spikes initially spawning but with high-healing food such as Karambwan the fight is manageable. When Sucellus fires acid, run to the other side of the room while being careful not to get hit by the spikes or his arms, and when he opens his eye make sure you're hiding behind the pillar closest to you!\n* After Sucellus is taken care of, take the key that he drops and enter the room on the west side of the main hallway. Talk with the Assassin and open the chest in the corner to receive Sucellus' medallion.\n* After obtaining the medallion, place it on the south-west Statue at the quest start location. \n** Be wary that the Mysterious Figure may attack you if you return to your home before placing the medallion on the Statue. You can escape the Stranger by exiting your home. The previous suggestion of having two combat styles may apply here as well."

The Moon will periodically spawn ice spikes on the floor around the block of ice which must be avoided by stepping off of them.\n**** Brazier - The Moon extinguishes the two braziers at the edges of the room, similar to the braziers in Wintertodt.

Run to Eyatlalli's glyph and attack the jaguar.

You must face your character toward each clone as it spawns to prevent damage. One method is to click the tile below each clone as it spawns.

If at any point you fight a bot, just let it kill you and report it, it isn't worth the time to fight it.\n**Even if you hate PvP, the rune pouch is an extremely important item for Ultimate Ironman that you will need eventually.

Some items are easy to collect while others are harder to obtain, such as a nature talisman.\n***If you do happen to get tasked to collect a nature talisman, the most viable option is to do Enter the Abyss and kill the abyssal leechs or complete Temple of the Eye too and do Guardians of the Rift until you acquire 50 abyssal pearls from the rewards. There is a safespot for them at a specific part of the Abyss. Killing them is extremely difficult though as getting into the safespot is very hard with our current stats, and if you die there it will be difficult to get your items back. It is worthwhile to simply go off the guide path and get 43 Prayer now. Safespot blue dragons with fire strike then use the bones on the wilderness altar. Death pile your items to be safe when using the bones. This is a slow, but vastly better than wiping in the abyss. Note that you can also change your respawn location to Falador. You will also need to get some sort of prayer restoration since the Abyss drains your prayer. Starting Zogre Flesh Eaters is potential way to get this.

Protect it with the apples. It is smart to plant it at Taverley for future willow log supply.\n*Clean out your inventory if you have anything. It should just be runes, coins, and the dramen staff.\n*The guide will move forward from here as the tree grows. When it does grow, complete Enlightened Journey.

You could also thieve them from Master farmers if you want to go out of your way for that.

This guide will not outline an exact method for this, but trust that it is a lot more clunky to setup than using the adamant arrow method (You need a light source, and buying bolts requires you to have your cash stack). Also, the maple shortbow with adamant arrows does more dps against the green dragons anyways.\n**This guide intentially avoids completing Dragon Slayer I so that you cannot get dragon tasks later.

Be careful not to die to the Lesser Demon.\n* Leave the Lava Maze and return to the Ferox Enclave.

If you are worried, you can keep a few food. \n* Head to Varrock and sell the platebodies to Horvik. Sell 2 per world. \n* Head back to the wilderness, destroy the looting bag, and get your platebodies, and sell those to Horvik.\n* Head to Aubury and purchase runes until you have 4500 mind, and 9000 air runes. \n** Optionally, you could only buy about 1100 casts of fire strike at a time, then store the extra money at clan wars. Then buy a new set of runes after each inventory of bones. This mitigates the risk of dying at the altar, but does take longer to walk around. \n* Head to the Isle of Souls Dungeon and safespot blue dragons there. Make sure to have high run energy when you enter the dungeon so you can run past everything. \n* Once you have a full inventory of Dragon Bones, minigame teleport to clan wars.\n* Deposit all extra coins there. This is a reserve to replace the money used in the rest of the guide normally obtained from the stronghold of security. \n* Walk to the chaos altar and use the bones. \n** Dying here is very costly, so be careful and ready to log out at any sign of danger. If you want, you could bring some food to greatly increase the chance of surviving a pvp encounter.  Some options include wine from draynor village, chocolate cake from Ardougne, or Karambwans from Brimhaven. If you bring 20 dragon bones per trip, you will reach 43 prayer in 5 trips on average. You may want to do 21or 22 though in case you have bad luck. \n* Return to the Isle of Souls dungeon (note that the Ferox enclave connects to Soul Wars), get more bones, and repeat.\n* 43 prayer should take around 4 inventories, depending on your luck. If you are a bit short, you can get bones from the Bone Yard to make up the difference. Also, some of the early quests in the guide have small prayer experience rewards. \n* If you do this method, then you will likely want to keep the law rune reward from Monk's Friend and get a few extra teleports early on.",

Getting 31 this way doesn't take long.\n**Alternatively, you can get this crafting xp passively from making guardians at Guardians of the Rift. This will prevent you from stacking up as many cosmic runes for early magic xp though.\n*Home teleport.\n*Buy an axe from bob and get 36 woodcutting.\n*Death pile at the Draynor Jail Guards and complete Lost City\n**If you don't have some fire strike runes, buy some first. Make sure to include fire runes as you won't have the staff.\n* Start playing Guardians of the Rift. The first goal is to get to level 50 Runecraft.\n* Keep Cosmic, Chaos, and Nature runes. \n**Do not do any searches until at least level 50, so that you can get the large pouch. Your medium pouch will degrade, but that is alright.\n* Once you reach level 50 Runecraft, pull all your searches. You should get the Large Pouch, as well as a large amount of runes. You will also get pearls and potentially other items. \n**What you do with the pearls will depend on your future plans and how quickly you plan to return to the minigame. If you do not plan to return for a long time, it won't be worth keeping them as they use an inventory slot.\n** It is also a reasonable option to just stay here at Guardians of the Rift until around 65 Runecraft and aim to get the Ring of the Elements now. The down side to this is that you will be down 2 inventory spaces due to not having a Rune Pouch, but it isn't really a huge difference. If you choose to do this, charge the ring before you dispose of your Runes and Pouches!\n* Now that you have a stock of runes, buy a staff of fire and head to the Mage Training Arena to train Magic until hopefully level 51 for Ardougne Teleport. \n** Use the nature runes at the alchemy room.\n** Use the cosmic runes with a fire staff once you get 49 Magic in the enchantment room. \n** Use extra law runes at the telekinetic room, up to 201 telekinetic points. Don't use up all your law runes though.\n** If you do not end up with enough runes to reach level 51, then you can just do more Guardians of the Rift to make up the difference. Also, you could aim for level 55 instead of 51, which is likely require more runes unless you got lucky with your searches. \n**Any runes or items you don't plan to use can be put in a looting bag for now.\n*Once finished with this Magic training, retrieve any runes you need from the bag and set yourself up for some questing. You should have hopefully gotten a supply of law runes from the searches to teleport around. If you did not, then you can complete Death Plateau and Troll Stronghold then return to Guardians of the Rift until you can craft some law runes to use. \n* Start Questing and work towards 750 total level to get a rune pouch from Last Man Standing. You can follow the main guide path, or go a bit out of order for quests that give a lot of total levels. Additionally, you could just skill by training skills like Firemaking or Woodcutting. \n** Keep in mind that you still need 70 Agility, and getting the graceful outfit would be a good idea. Also, while the need for money has been greatly offset by getting runes from Guardians of the Rift, there are still other things the require money. You will probably have to do at least some laps at the Agility Pyramid or another money making method while going on this side quest for 750 total level, or just to continue moving forward in the guide. \n** A good idea would be to return to Agility, get the Graceful Outfit, do a bit of Agility Pyramid for cash, then follow the guide until you finish the 50 construction grind. This will allow you to store your graceful top so it doesn't conflict with the varrock armour as well as provide a lot of total levels along the way. Having the essence pouches in your inventory is a bit of a hassle, but is manageable. You could also just drop the pouches and reobtain them later. \n*When you are ready, return to Guardians of the Rift. \n**Consider waiting to return until you can use the NPC Contact spell to repair pouches. Otherwise, repair your pouches with pearls. \n*** This is not a big deal until you have a Giant Pouch as the lower tier pouches do not degrade very quickly. \n***You can optionally not even worry about NPC contact, as using pearls to fix the pouches is also perfectly fine and sustainable. \n**Once you have the level for Law Runes, take a break and complete Death Plateau and Troll Stronghold. Or just do this before returning. \n**Once you have level 65, consider taking a break until you can complete Mourning's End Part II.\n** Once you have level 77, consider taking a break until you can complete Sins of the Father. You can also leave at this point and make blood runes on Zeah. This detours heavily from the main goal of this guide, but is a great source of cash.\n** You can consider buying the Ring of the Elements with your pearls to speed up the construction grind."
