Click them all to not take 30+ damage from the root. It can be helpful to eat before or after clearing this special to avoid losing DPS ticks to eat delay.\n** An easy way to get past this boss is by purposely standing in a quadrant and accepting the axes that hit you. It's significantly less damage than running around misreading. The axes do sub 20 damage and the bleed only ticks for 2 dmg when you attack/move. Keep movement to a minimum and only dodge the floor spikes (1–2 tiles).\n* After defeating Vardorvis, pick up the temple key and bring it back to Kasonde in the Temple. Be aware that you are about to fight another boss.\n* Kasonde will attack you. Dodge his explosions and poison splats.\n** Pray Protect from Missiles and kite while attacking with Ranged. Crossbow with diamond bolts (e) works well.\n** The green splats will venom you, bring anti venom of some sort.\n** Stepping on orange splats will damage you around 15 Hitpoints and disable protection Prayers.\n** He will do a charge attack, have one of the pillars block line of sight to avoid damage.\n** He will continue to heal as you fight. The only way to kill him is to out dps his healing. Ironmen using melee will find a dragon dagger useful. When his health is low, use the dragon dagger special attack. Strangely, a Zamorakian Hasta special attack clears all liquid on the floor left from vials. \n** The bow of Faerdhinen with crystal armour is very effective for the fight.\n* After defeating him talk to him to find out where the medallion is, then proceed to the next room and search the stone chest for another tatty page.\n* Return to the hideout with the barricade and search the stone chest in the north-east corner to obtain Vardorvis' medallion. \n* Take the medallion to the Ancient Vault north-east of Nardah and use it on Vardorvis' statue in the north-east corner."

      "* Prepare to fight Duke Sucellus. You can go to a bank and return safely.\n* Enter the Dragonstone Gate, in the very far north-east section of the prison (NOT IN ADMINISTRATION AREA).\n* Once inside the Asylum, Duke Sucellus' chamber is located directly north of you but the Duke himself is asleep. On the sides there are extremities that periodically open their eyes, their gaze emitting a red cone. You will need to run past the extremities while also avoiding stunning energy attacks emitting from the floor indicated by a shadow: If hit by the extremities, you will take large amounts of damage..\n* Once past the extremities, there are arder and musca mushrooms, one on each site. 80+ Herblore: Pick 2 of each mushroom and use a pestle & mortar on them, under 80 herblore: pick 3 of each; afterwards make your way to the centre of the room where there are two barrels you must deposit the grounded mushrooms into. On the sides of the arena, near the middle pillars are salt deposits which you must mine: You need 12 parts of salt and each mushroom dust to fill the two barrels and obtain two Arder-musca poisons.\n* When you have the two poisons, drink your potions and activate Piety and use the poisons on Duke Sucellus which will begin the fight. Sucellus has several attacks, most of which deal a lot of damage if they hit you:\n** Sucellus slams his arms on the floor, summoning spikes of ice on every tile directly adjacent to him. The spikes deal 0-12 chip damage, but Sucellus' melee hits can deal upwards of 30.\n** If you're not within melee reach, Sucellus will fire a blue magic orb that can hit through Protect from Magic, though with reduced damage. \n** Sucellus spits out acid clouds, which can deal rapid damage upwards of 10 every game tick. As soon as you see him spit the acid, run to the pillar on the other side of the room while avoiding standing on any tile that's directly adjacent to Sucellus.\n** Every 6 attacks Sucellus opens his eye and unleashes his gaze upon you: Hide behind one of the pillars closest to you as soon as this happens or the attack will deal 90+ damage.\n* Sucellus is weak to demonbane weapons and his spike attack deals less damage than his Magic so Arclight is an ideal weapon to dispose of him. An easy way to defeat Sucellus is to equip as much Strength-boosting gear as possible and stand directly behind one of the two pillars closest to him. Every time Sucellus uses his ground slam attack, as soon as his arms hit the ground hit him and immediately run back behind the pillar, as if you were flinching him: You will take chip damage from the spikes initially spawning but with high-healing food such as Karambwan the fight is manageable. When Sucellus fires acid, run to the other side of the room while being careful not to get hit by the spikes or his arms, and when he opens his eye make sure you're hiding behind the pillar closest to you!\n* After Sucellus is taken care of, take the key that he drops and enter the room on the west side of the main hallway. Talk with the Assassin and open the chest in the corner to receive Sucellus' medallion.\n* After obtaining the medallion, place it on the south-west Statue at the quest start location. \n** Be wary that the Mysterious Figure may attack you if you return to your home before placing the medallion on the Statue. You can escape the Stranger by exiting your home. The previous suggestion of having two combat styles may apply here as well."

It can use a magical, stat-lowering attack after every 3-4 attacks, then proceeding to change attack styles based on the player's protection prayer.\n\n* Fight overview: \n**yellow head -> ranged\n**blue head -> magic\n**white head -> melee\n** The Elemental will start praying against your attack styles at 50% of its hitpoints.\n** At 25% the Elemental will attack faster, harder and have double prayers up. Be sure to correctly pray against the style since it can hit high 30s on a 2-tick speed attack whilst switching attack styles as well.\n**Make sure you drink your restores if the elemental reduces your stats or bring a menaphite remedy and drink it before the fight starts so it will restore your stats when weakened.\n**It is recommended that you use one of the pillars at 25% since you can exchange hits 1:1 and take your time to have the right prayer protection up. Or focus on prayers first, and then your switches, as you only have 1 tick to react. If the attack hits you off prayer it will drain your stats and prayer.\n\n* If you die while fighting the Balance Elemental, your grave will appear at the top of the chasm at Tears of Guthix.\n* Upon defeating it, search the stone again to view a short cutscene.\n* Once Movario and Darve appear, choose all chat options for Movario.\n* Once Lucien appears, choose all chat options for him.\n* Fight the two tormented demons alongside the Guardians of Armadyl.\n** They are surrounded by a flame shield that reduces all damage dealt by 75% that can only be disabled with demonbane weapons, though this should not be an issue for this fight thanks to the player's power-up from the Stone of Jas.\n** They can use protection prayers, switching prayers after taking a certain amount of damage.\n** They can also switch attack styles based on the player's protection prayers every 16 seconds or so.\n* Upon defeating the demons, speak to Idria and have her teleport you to White Knights' Castle.\n* Speak to Idria again to complete the quest.\n* Congratulations, quest complete!"
