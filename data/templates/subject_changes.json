The timer will also disappear when time runs out.\n*Ghosts will now spawn after the loot is collected to not interrupt the action. They will also stop stealing the player's loot when their dialogue is interrupted.\n*Players will now receive slightly more hallowed marks on floors 1–3 and slightly fewer on floors 4 and 5 (including the Grand Coffin), and players can now loot multiple coffins on floors 3 and 4. The rarity of the strange old lockpick has been adjusted to account for the multiple chests available on each floor.\n*Players can now enter the barrier leading to the Grand Coffin while stood on either side of it and instances where players would be stuck when descending to a new floor have been resolved.\n*The price of hallowed tokens has been decreased from 15 hallowed marks to 10 and hallowed items can no longer be alchemised.\n*The amount of experience gained after completing a floor has been decreased.\n*On floor 2, some blue teleport pads have been added to the north, east and west paths, and the last fire trap on the east path now has a more reasonable respawn coordinate if players fail at the end of it.\n*On floor 3, the first sword traps on the west and east path now wait five cycles between catching and throwing the sword so that they are slightly more forgiving, and the firing rate of the bolts on the final trap has been slowed down by one tick.\n*On floor 4, a missing pad has been added to the sword trap at the end of the north path to indicate where the sword stops, the sword and fire trap combination on the south path now has two possible solutions to reduce the amount of wait time, the last two flames of the fire trap on the northern path are now active on every rotation, and the final bolt and teleport pad combination on the south path now has some blue teleport pads.\n*On floor 5, the bolt statues for the final trap have been moved forward slightly so their animations can be seen more easily, and the first bolt and teleport pad combination trap now has a few more blue teleport tiles.",
