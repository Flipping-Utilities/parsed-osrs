      "* Before the player has given the thick dye to Gregg or learned about the intent to paint Ned's door, the player can ask Ned one step too early for his permission to paint the door.\n* After the player has given the thick dye to Gregg, Ned will thank the player for painting his door with extra colours and exclaims the door to be missing something, before the door is actually painted.\n* Before the player has learned Gregg didn't do the decorations when he got back to Draynor and Ned did this, the player praises Ned for his excellent work on the decorations.\n* Immediately after painting Ned's door but before being offered by Gregg to be teleported to Lumbridge, if the player asks the Cook about the Easter event, the player will question prematurely if the eggs the Cook gave to Gregg were rotten ones, in spite of the fact Gregg has not made it to the kitchen, the player hasn't asked the Cook for \"fancy eggs\", and Gregg has not received any \"colourful eggs\" from the Cook yet. \n* If the player and Gregg teleport from the Lumber Yard to Draynor together, Thessalia's dialogue will change to tell the player Gregg is at Draynor (as evidently intended). However, if the player skips teleporting with Gregg from the Lumber Yard, travels to Draynor Village manually and talks to Gregg there at this time (as may be unintended), Gregg will not be seen at the Lumber Yard again (as evidently intended), but the script updating Thessalia's dialogue to tell the player Gregg is at Draynor will not trigger, thus her dialogue will continue to incorrectly hint Gregg to be at the Lumber Yard instead of Draynor Village. Thessalia's dialogue will be glitched, but the event can be completed as normal without softlocking. The technical explanation for this is that the player's state of progression of the 2021 Easter event is tracked as an enumerated value, while a hint if the player should go to the Lumber Yard is tracked separately as a boolean value. The event state of progression is observed to control the primary flow of the event and the appearance of Gregg's persona at various places at any time. The hint boolean value is observed to have small adjustments to Gregg's choice of hints at Draynor and Thessalia's choice of the hint of Gregg's next location. These two values can become out of sync with each other. \n When Thessalia instructs the player's best bet is to talk to the sawmill operator at the Lumber Yard, the event's enumerated state changes to value 79 and the Lumber Yard hint will be enabled (changes to value 1 ). \n When Gregg will be ready to return to Draynor from the Lumber Yard, the event state's value will be 104 ; the value of the Lumber Yard hint will be unchanged at this time as 1 . Gregg can be found at the Lumber Yard as normal, while his dialogue at Draynor Village will be changed.\n If the player teleports with Gregg as offered, the event's enumerated value will be changed to 105, Gregg will no longer be seen at the Lumber Yard, and the Lumber Yard hint will be disabled (changed to 0 ), and the event stays in sync. After this, talking to Gregg at Draynor Village would then change the value 105 → 125 to progress in the event. \n However, if Gregg will be ready to return to Draynor and the player doesn't teleport from the Lumberyard to Draynor with Gregg, the event state's value will be 104 as before. Talking to Gregg at Draynor will then change the enumerated value 104 → 125 , which will progress the event and removes Gregg's persona from the Lumber Yard. In this scenario, 104 → 105 → 125 won't be observed and the Lumber Yard value will stay enabled (unchanged as 1 )."
