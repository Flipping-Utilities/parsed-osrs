However, unlike them, every part of this plant is poisonous, with it reaching its peak deadliness just after flowering. The flowers are thankfully easily identifiable due to being bell-shaped, dull purple and faintly scented. Symptoms of belladonna poisoning include sensitivity to light, blurred vision, loss of balance, staggering, headaches, rash, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, and convulsions. Its only real use is in the production of poison.",
