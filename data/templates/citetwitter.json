Additionally, the image says \"Fruit Trees have 4 chances of becoming diseased\" but it's actually five, as can be seen in Apple tree seed for example. Therefore his statement that \"fruit trees have a 96.9% chance of surviving\" if using ultracompost is incorrect -- it is actually 96.15%. Additionally, collected data shows that it is overwhelmingly likely that when creating the graphic, Kieren adjusted the denominator by one to account for a random roll of 0-127, but did not also adjust the numerator, hence the difference in table by +1.",

When the prince reached 0 HP, it wouldn't die, but carried on hitting the player, and the player couldn't move or access their inventory, so they'd likely end up dying. The dev and his supervisor couldn't diagnose it for days, and didn't escalate it to anyone who could. If you're wondering how that happened, it's because the dev wrote the cutscene in a unique way, trying to stop the player clicking out, so the player was frozen and had their inventory blocked by the cutscene behaviour, and the cutscene malfunctioned if the player had a pet.",
