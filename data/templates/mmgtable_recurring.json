Bring these items (in noted form) to Wyson the gardener who will exchange them for nest boxes. Around 72% of nest boxes received will be seed nests, 20% will be jewellery nests, and 8% will be empty nests.\n\nTake these boxes to a bank and in the bank deposit interface, right-click each box to deposit their contents directly into your bank. Then, begin the click-intensive process of separating the seeds and jewellery from the nests. For seed nests withdraw 16 at a time, for jewellery nests withdraw 14 at a time. Expect to open between 4000 to 6000 nests per hour.\n\nPlease note that mole claws and mole skins have a relatively low buying limit (50 for each). It will take roughly days to buy 6000 mole parts.\n\nPlease also note that if one is unlucky and mainly receives lower valued seeds without the more expensive seeds such as Dragonfruit seeds, Redwood tree seeds, and Spirit seeds, one can lose money with this method. Therefore it is recommended to save up a large number of mole parts before attempting this method.\n\nPlayers can also crush the nests for additional profit. With the inclusions of Dragonfruit tree seed, Redwood tree seed, and Celastrus seed the actual profit may vary, but more tests need to be done with these new seeds added to the pool.",

    "details": "This guide assumes 8.8 herbs from each patch, thus 70 (70.4) herbs. Your profit per hour may vary depending on the survival rate. This also assumes you can access all the patches except the one in Harmony Island\n\nFarming grimy avantoe can be a very profitable way to spend a few minutes at a time. Magic secateurs help increase profits slightly due to the 10% boost to crop yield. Generally, good harvests yield 6-15 herbs, but the norm is six to ten herbs per patch, so players can expect an average of 8.8 herbs each patch.\n\nPlayers should have 5-9 avantoe seeds, some runes, and a means of teleportation. Then, players can start their herb run at any herb patch withdrawing any additional supplies needed from the tool leprechaun. If players have access to the Lunar Spellbook from Lunar Diplomacy, Fertile Soil (83 Magic) can be used in lieu of Ultracompost, but it will make the profit per patch, thus total. Also, Spellbook Swap can be used to access the standard spellbook and Trollheim Teleport, but it requires 96 Magic and Dream Mentor.\n\nPlayers can increase their profits:\n*If they attune an Amulet of Nature to one of their herb patches, and keep it with them while doing other tasks around the game, so that they can check frequently whether their crops are fully grown\n*If they use the Geomancy spell that can monitor the health of their patches and tell them when their patches are fully grown\n*If they plant Anima plants (76 Farming, boostable), like Iasor, Kronos, or Attas, which decrease the rate of disease, decrease the amount of time it takes for crops to grow, or increase the yield of their crops, respectively\n\nPlayers who have completed Dream Mentor, have 83 Magic (boost possible), and who have read the Ash covered tome (Volcanic Mine minigame) may use Fertile Soil instead of Ultracompost. This makes inventory management somewhat easier, however, 1 cast of Fertile Soil costs  at current prices, while Ultracompost costs  each at current prices. Considering that player can reduce their run times marginally with more inventory spaces freed up by only needing to use 3 inventory slots (a Rune Pouch, a slot for Staff of Earth/Magic Secateurs, and a slot for Volcanic ash), as opposed to 5-9 slots for each Ultracompost, the additional cost using Fertile Soil might still increase profits if run time can be reduced enough, considering that herb runs are very profitable in general. Players need only use 2 inventory slots if they opt to not bring a Staff of Earth, and instead fill their Rune Pouches with Earth Runes. This increases the cost of 1 Fertile Soil cast to .\n\nAlternatively, players may use a Bottomless compost bucket to make inventory management easier.\n\nAfter planting, a player can move onto the next patch in any order.

This also assumes you can access all the patches except the one in Harmony Island\n\nFarming grimy cadantine can be a very profitable way to spend a few minutes at a time. Magic secateurs help increase profits slightly due to the 10% boost to crop yield. Generally, good harvests yield 6-15 herbs, but the norm is six to ten herbs per patch, so players can expect an average of 8.8 herbs each patch.\n\nPlayers should have 5-9 cadantine seeds, some runes, and a means of teleportation. Then, players can start their herb run at any herb patch withdrawing any additional supplies needed from the tool leprechaun. If players have access to the Lunar Spellbook from Lunar Diplomacy, Fertile Soil (83 Magic) can be used in lieu of Ultracompost, but it will make the profit per patch, thus total.

This makes inventory management somewhat easier, however, 1 cast of Fertile Soil costs  at current prices, while Ultracompost costs  each at current prices. Considering that player can reduce their run times marginally with more inventory spaces freed up by only needing to use 3 inventory slots (a Rune Pouch, a slot for Staff of Earth/Magic Secateurs, and a slot for Volcanic ash), as opposed to 5-9 slots for each Ultracompost, the additional cost using Fertile Soil might still increase profits if run time can be reduced enough, considering that herb runs are very profitable in general.

Magic secateurs help increase profits slightly due to the 10% boost to crop yield. Generally, good harvests yield 6-15 herbs, but the norm is six to ten herbs per patch, so players can expect an average of 8.8 herbs each patch.\n\nPlayers should have 5-9 lantadyme seeds, some runes, and a means of teleportation. Then, players can start their herb run at any herb patch withdrawing any additional supplies needed from the tool leprechaun. If players have access to the Lunar Spellbook from Lunar Diplomacy, Fertile Soil (83 Magic) can be used in lieu of Ultracompost, but it will make the profit per patch, thus total. Also, Spellbook Swap can be used to access the standard spellbook and Trollheim Teleport, but it requires 96 Magic and Dream Mentor.\n\nPlayers can increase their profits:\n*If they attune an Amulet of Nature to one of their herb patches, and keep it with them while doing other tasks around the game, so that they can check frequently whether their crops are fully grown\n*If they use the Geomancy spell that can monitor the health of their patches and tell them when their patches are fully grown\n*If they plant Anima plants (76 Farming, boostable), like Iasor, Kronos, or Attas, which decrease the rate of disease, decrease the amount of time it takes for crops to grow, or increase the yield of their crops, respectively\n\nPlayers who have completed Dream Mentor, have 83 Magic (boost possible), and who have read the Ash covered tome (Volcanic Mine minigame) may use Fertile Soil instead of Ultracompost. This makes inventory management somewhat easier, however, 1 cast of Fertile Soil costs  at current prices, while Ultracompost costs  each at current prices. Considering that player can reduce their run times marginally with more inventory spaces freed up by only needing to use 3 inventory slots (a Rune Pouch, a slot for Staff of Earth/Magic Secateurs, and a slot for Volcanic ash), as opposed to 5-9 slots for each Ultracompost, the additional cost using Fertile Soil might still increase profits if run time can be reduced enough, considering that herb runs are very profitable in general. Players need only use 2 inventory slots if they opt to not bring a Staff of Earth, and instead fill their Rune Pouches with Earth Runes. This increases the cost of 1 Fertile Soil cast to .\n\nAlternatively, players may use a Bottomless compost bucket to make inventory management easier.\n\nAfter planting, a player can move onto the next patch in any order.
