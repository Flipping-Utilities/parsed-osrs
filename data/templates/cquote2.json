[...] An extra day is added to Moevyng every four years to account for an anomaly in the way the calendar has been calculated. Moevyng Day, as it is called, tends to fall in the middle of the month.\n\nThe most intriguingly-named month is the Ire of Phyrrys. My colleagues over at the Observatory have uncovered the charred remains of a diary that belonged to Phyrrys, apprentice to the astronomer Scorpius.\n\nEarly entries in Phyrrys's diary tell of how he was attempting to figure out the RuneScape calendar, based upon the astronomical studies his mentor was conducting. However, a few pages have survived of Scorpius's own diary, heavily hinting at Phyrrys's ineptitude, and how at the culmination of the apprentice's initial calendar research, he'd failed to account for a whole forty days.\n\nThis is backed up in Phyrrys's own diary entries, whereby from this date on, his anger (ire) seemed to grow and grow at his inability to work these forty days into the calendar. It is assumed that a later inhabitant of the Observatory found these notes and, quite easily, corrected the mistake by placing them between Septober and Novtumber, naming the month in honour (or more likely in jest) of the 'challenged' Phyrrys.",

      "Hey guys,\n\nI want to take a few moments to apologise to you and explain where, why, how and what next will happen with regards to the new duck NPC in Falador Park.\nFirst off, we think it's important to explain the motives and reasoning behind the decision to add a new NPC to the game outside of poll. The original duck model was built inside the Easter event earlier this year, and as a nice gesture, I decided to move it to Falador park and rename it after a popular streamer as a thank you for their feedback and continued effort to support the game. Initially, this wasn't part of our development plan or schedule and was implemented quickly to have it in-game in time for the removal of Easter.\n\nIn retrospect, it's clear that the decision wasn't in line with our ethos and caused a considerable upset and division within the community, something we definitely did not intend to happen. Furthermore, the handling of the situation in regards to the removal of topics discussing the duck, whether they be positive or negative, was definitely poor.\nAs a result, the NPC has been removed from the game in the update which went live earlier.\n\nLastly, but by no means least, I'd like to take this opportunity to apologise for this incident. It's not within our nature to cause divisions or negative sentiment within our communities and part of what makes us a strong and focussed team is the support, feedback and continued existence of all player driven and controlled communities – Something we have always taken time to engage ourselves with and support.\nTo sum up, what do you think we should do next to ensure the quality and implementation of updates are in line with your expectations and how we can avoid situations like this in future.\n\nMod Reach and the Old School Team.\"",

He served with the Black Guard at Ice Mountain and in Kandarin. He was present at the battle of Barendir when he fought against an army of trolls. It was here that he got his nickname, the Butcher of Barendir, as he mercilessly killed the trolls even as they retreated in defeat. Here, also, he got his distinctive scar running across his forehead in a hand-to-hand battle with a particularly ferocious troll. After this battle Grimsson became more and more aggressive, even to his fellow dwarves. Following a particularly vicious attack on a comrade, he was dismissed from the Black Guard. Soon after, he was recruited by the Red Axe. Here he's learned to control his rage and become even stronger. By now, he has become the right hand dwarf of the director.

Taken in by the Red Axe and nursed back to health, it turned out that he was in fact a powerful ogre shaman. Intelligent by ogre standards, and steadfastly loyal to his rescuers, he has taken up a prominent position in the ranks of the Red Axe. This is primarily due to the fact that since dwarves cannot use magic, they must rely on other races as spellcasters. Grunsh fits the bill perfectly."

Only the sturdiest races survived the God Wars, and even then only by abandoning their high culture and gearing their societies towards war. Of the more delicate races there is now no trace, and almost no memory. One such race had bodies as fragile as snowflakes, yet they built crystal cities that stood for a thousand years. The wind would whisper through the spires and fill them with sweet harmonies, and the rising sun would shine through the precious gems that studded the towers and create inter plays of light as if rainbows were dancing. Indeed, so marvelous was this light-show that the patterns of light themselves became alive, and great flocks of luminous creatures rode along the gem cast beams, each drawn to its own colour. The creatures you see floating in this chasm are the last sorry remnants of that age. I do not know how they made their way here and survived to this time, but I am grateful for their company.",

A few RuneScapers weren't satisfied with their response to the situation and so we escalated the issue to our anti-cheating specialists who have confirmed that their statements were correct.\n\nThey have confirmed that:\n\nMousekeys (i.e. the windows accessibility tool) is allowed (it always has been); anything else is third party software and is not. If the team see evidence that a player is using AHK's, super-mousekeys or any other versions of this macroing software then they will take action against them. If a player is using normal mousekeys, they won't. The team are perfectly capable of detecting both and telling the difference between them.\n\nWhen it comes to skilling, mousekeys can potentially give an advantage when it comes to emptying the inventory quickly, however this requires a certain level of skill, though the following section of macroing rule is quite clear in regards to this behaviour:\n\n\"Software that generates input to our game applets. This includes software that automatically moves the mouse pointer or generates mouse clicks or key presses.\"\n\nNow, mousekeys do not generate input as that is done by the user; it doesn't automatically move the mouse pointer to a specified coordinate, it moves it at a steady pace in the direction specified by the key pressed (2,4,6 or 8) and stops doing so when the key is released. It doesn't generate mouse clicks (as that is done by the user pressing 5) and it doesn't generate key presses. Without augmentation or modification (adjusting the inbuilt settings is not augmentation or modification and is fine) mousekeys are not capable of violating the rules against third party software.",

We vary the raw trawl of accounts from time to time to fit our needs, for example we have recently focused on OS game bias from Australian time zones.\n \nOnce we have that list we review each account for reports made about it, display name history and linked accounts to identify rule breaking on undesirable behaviour on alternative accounts. We then do some due diligence checks to see if any of the accounts are linked to cheating communities or have any links or concerns in relation to Community Safety issues. Once we have that list we extract any accounts that log in from countries whose Authorities provide public searchable *** offender records and, where possible, run a sense check against public records. We then run a hijacking check to see if the account user is involved in account phishing or other activity such as name selling or account selling and then finally a check of any payment fraud history. We sometimes do a few further adhoc checks such as removing accounts with a lot of public wi-fi or proxy access.\n \nOnce we have that final list the players can be invited and if they accept the invite they will move into a state where they can't mute anyone and their reports are closely monitored for about 2 months. Once we are happy that the reporting is of a good standard we move the account to a full P Mod status which means they can mute and also that the accounts are then checked weekly for security, activity and mute accuracy.\n  \nHope that helps.",

It came very quickly to me once I was in the shanty-writing groove. It has remained in the game for well over a decade, and has always enjoyed a degree of notoriety because it's a cheesy earworm. Since Old School RuneScape launched in 2013, we came to realise that the fanbase had re-embraced the track, and it has become a meme. There are plenty of silly videos featuring it, Rick-Rolling, etc. Although it makes me cringe a little, I don't mind it being a humorous song as it has charm. One of my ambitions in life is to write a novelty track and retire from the proceeds. \"Sea Shanty 2\" might be my best effort yet, but sadly I'm not close to retiring...",
