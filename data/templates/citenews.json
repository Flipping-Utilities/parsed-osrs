In it, we stated that each boss slain gave a 1/56 chance of obtaining its respective armour set, totalling a 3/56 (or ~1/18.67) chance for a unique. That much is correct! What's not correct is our statement that defeating all three bosses would provide an additional 1/56 roll at any item, for a total of 1/14. This is not the case and has never been the case, we just got some wires crossed with our post last week and can only apologise for that!",

Once a non-Ultimate Iron player has a Zulrah kill count of 50 or more, she will start charging 100,000 coins to return your items, matching Torfinn's fee. This charge will not apply to Ultimate Iron players.",

    "quote": "Nothing is ever a hundred percent confirmed, but one of the things that we've been very keen to draw on is Varlamore, there's been so much support and enthusiasm from players when it comes to Varlamore, like the drawing maps and stuff - Especially after there was a lot of dissatisfaction with the original Kourend release. That's why we've pulled so many names from the player suggestions and there is currently, in the current Varlamore pitch, which is by no means final, and by no means canon anyway, there is an Auburnvale. It is a little bit different story-wise to what any of the player suggestions have been, but there is a settlement with that name currently.",
