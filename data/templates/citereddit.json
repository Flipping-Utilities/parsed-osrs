Let's say you are level 50 farming, and have an irit plant ready to harvest and a guam plant. The chances come in with whether you lose a life or not each pick of a herb. Your base chance of not losing a life when picking a guam would be roughly 53/255. Your base chance of not losing a life when picking an irit would be roughly 63/255. These chances scale depending on your level, but all peak at the same probability at level 99. These chances are what are affected by diary rewards / secateurs etc.",

    "quote": "Regardless, if you're 99 farming, your average yield from guam and torstol will be exactly the same.\n\nHowever it is not the same at all levels...\n\nLet's say you are level 50 farming, and have an irit plant ready to harvest and a guam plant. The chances come in with whether you lose a life or not each pick of a herb.\n\nYour base chance of not losing a life when picking a guam would be roughly 53/255.\n\nYour base chance of not losing a life when picking an irit would be roughly 63/255.\n\nThese chances scale depending on your level, but all peak at the same probability at level 99.\n\nThese chances are what are affected by diary rewards / secateurs etc.",

The current boss is more creature like but actually has shape language of a ‘typical magic pker’, with the horns being based on Mystics, and a massive ancient symbol in its back as a nod to the staff.",
