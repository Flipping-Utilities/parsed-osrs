    "quote": "You should only need to actually successfully hit him 10 times. There's a few things that might be the problem here: - Your ability to throw snowballs is loosely tied to your ranged level, so you may not hit him every time. - It is quite easy to hit players rather than anti-santa if the world is busy. It didn't look like it was the problem here. - You need to stand on firm ground when the snowball lands so you can hear what Anti-santa has to say about it. If you're sliding you'll have to throw another one. You don't actually have to be on the field to pelt him. You can stand outside of the fence and get it from there.",

Let's say you are level 50 farming, and have an irit plant ready to harvest and a guam plant. The chances come in with whether you lose a life or not each pick of a herb. Your base chance of not losing a life when picking a guam would be roughly 53/255. Your base chance of not losing a life when picking an irit would be roughly 63/255. These chances scale depending on your level, but all peak at the same probability at level 99. These chances are what are affected by diary rewards / secateurs etc.",
