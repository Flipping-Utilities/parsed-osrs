    "details": "The profit rate assumes chests looted per hour. Your actual profits may be higher or lower depending on your speed and luck.\n\n\n\nThe GP per hour depends on how many chests you can get. One chest is worth around  with Morytania hard diary complete; with max gear and stats, you can complete upwards of 15 chests in an hour, earning around  profit without any rare drops.\n\nUsing the Maximum Efficiency setup you can complete around 20 chests an hour. Note, the inputs using Maximum Efficiency is different from the other methods due to using the Tumeken's shadow.\n\nWithout completing the diary, each chest is worth: .\n\nThe Barrows mini-game is a mid- to high-level Combat money-making method. The game takes a few tries to learn, but the long-term rewards are worth the effort. The goal is to slay all six brothers, gather the appropriate killcount in the tunnels, and then loot the Barrows chest. A single run could take anywhere from 3 minutes to 30 minutes depending on your level, though the most common strategy involves banking at the Ferox Enclave and using the rejuvenation pool there after each chest. This leads to 5 minute runs and far more efficient gold per hour due to using less supplies. For those that wish to save even more money by not using Barrows teleports, they can bank in Burgh de Rott after completing In Aid of the Myreque. Most runs will reward players with roughly  worth of runes and Bolt racks, but there is a 1/15 chance of receiving Barrows equipment, which can be sold at the Grand Exchange for high profit. The strategy guide can be found here.",

This method will take longer, as players will normally run out of run energy in between runs. Because of this, players will not bless as many symbols as they would using a skull sceptre to travel.\n\nSkull Sceptre Run: Players with stockpiled skull sceptre charges can use it to teleport to the entrance of the Stronghold of Security, and run either to the monastery. If doing this method, it is recommended to bring runes for Falador Teleport to bank. Doing so can shave 1 minute of travel from players that choose to run straight back and forth from the monastery and the bank. Since you are saving more time travelling, you will be able to do more runs, increasing the amount of symbols you can bless an hour.\n\nWith the unblessed symbols in your inventory, talk to Brother Jered in order to bless your symbols. Talk to him using the dialogue option: 'What can you do to help a bold adventurer such as myself?' Then you can choose 'Bless star'.\n\nAlternatively you can use these quick chat instructions: 1, Space, Space, 1, Space\n\nIt may also be worth trapping Brother Jered in the room containing the ladder, both to ensure slightly less distance to cover, as well as to ensure you never need to keep re-opening a door.",

You first grab coins from your bank, and run (as long as your weight is minimal, run energy will barely deplete) to the Inn. Talk to Kaylee, the waitress on the ground floor not behind the bar, and repeat this sequence:\n\n# Click on Kaylee.\n# Hold down spacebar to go through the three dialogue windows.\n# Find the ale which profits most on the Grand Exchange, and click 1, 2, or 3 to purchase the one you want (you can check by buying one of each and viewing their Grand Exchange price in your inventory).\n# Tap/hold spacebar to get through the dialogue, though you don't have to finish the dialogue \"Thanks, Haylee\" before talking to Haylee again.\n# Repeat steps 1-4 until you have filled your inventory with ale.\n\nAfter filling your inventory, run to the nearby bank and deposit all of your ale. Done efficiently, you can get an inventory in ~3 minutes, sometimes under 3! Later, sell your ale on the Grand Exchange for profit, though the ales will often sell for a bit under the Grand Exchange price.

    "details": "Team capes are items bought from several cape merchants. The merchants sell the capes starting for 50 coins each, however, on the Grand Exchange they can go for thousands of coins. The reason they are so sought after is because clans will buy them for clan battles and because players will die so much they need to stock up so they can re-gear. Players will buy the capes in bulk to stock up and this causes a price spike for certain capes, especially during the weekend, when clan battles tend to happen. The strategy of this money maker is to get from 50–1,500 coins (1,500 will buy a full inventory of capes from a full stock). Then you need to decide which store you are going to buy from. Check the team capes wiki page here. This will let you know which cape is currently selling for the most and so you will want to prioritize buying that cape first.\n\n\n\nSomething to keep in mind is that capes will rise and fall and price depending on if the cape is in use, however, even if no clan is buying the cape it will still be worth more than the 50 coins you paid for it. If your team cape stops selling at a high price you may need to drop the price to adjust for changes in the market. If your cape is selling instantly, try selling it at a bit of a higher price to maximise profit.\n\nThe cape merchants are located in the Wilderness and so this is a dangerous activity. You can die and lose your items in the wilderness to other players so look out for player killers. Keep in mind that when you die you will only be losing at most the 1,400 that you invested which is a relatively small loss. Even still if you want to maximise profit you should try this method during non-peak playing times to lower your chance of running into another player.\n\nAs you start to accumulate coins you can increase your total coins per hour by investing in energy potions. These will restore your run energy and therefore decrease the amount of time it takes you to run from the bank to a Cape merchant. Another strategy is to consider changing worlds when you buy out the cape sellers stock. Finally something to consider is to bring your own PK gear in order to try and kill other players buying capes or found along the way; this will also allow you to defend yourself from other PKers.",

Assuming the same intensity, a player with level 90 Fishing could expect to catch around 270 eels an hour. Additionally, players could wield their highest available Rada's blessing 4 for up to 8% chance of catching two eels at once. Lastly, access to Karamja gloves 1 is assumed for the significant Tokkul discount (and therefore a higher conversion rate of Tokkul to GP).\n\nThe primary source of profit from infernal eels comes from onyx bolt tips; although Lava scale shards and Tokkul are still a sizable amount of profit. The strategy for fishing is simple; whenever the inventory fills, the player smashes the eels with a hammer until the inventory is empty, then continues to fish infernal eels.\n\nThere is no delay in smashing eels so one can spam click to use a hammer on the last eel in the inventory. However, players can simply wait after smashing one eel, as the character will automatically smash the remainder; though it will be at a highly reduced rate. In either case, due to the time it takes for a full inventory of infernal eels to smash, this is considered a very low-attention profit method.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning additional profit may be acquired by completion of Clue bottles. Players can expect extended periods of time catching infernal eels without banking. As such, most trips will net several Clue Bottles. This, of course, increases profit margins considerably and provides enough breaks from active playing.\n\nAs a last reminder, it may be noted, that the GP/Tokkul conversion rate varies depending on the time of purchase. Conversely, uncut onyx, maintains a very steady price; it may therefore not be the best GP/Tokkul conversion at a certain time.

At 65 Fishing it will take, on average, 6.5 minutes to collect enough raw karambwanji for one hour of fishing Karambwan. At 99 Fishing, this will take about 4 minutes. It is recommended to fish karambwanji in bulk to avoid going back and forth excessively because raw karambwanji stack.\n\nWith sufficient bait, go to the karambwan fishing spot in north-eastern Karamja, near fairy ring . There are many routes for banking and returning, depending on account progression, but at minimum, partial completion of Fairytale II - Cure a Queen is recommended.\n\nThe closest, no-requirement bank is in Shayzien near fairy ring, returning via the same fairy ring. An alternative, slightly further, no-requirement bank for a more afk approach is at Zanaris, which is reachable through the fairy ring without modifying the fairy ring code.\n\nThe fastest method is to use Karamja gloves 3 or 4 to the Shilo Village mine, then quest point cape for quickest access to a fairy ring. Note that when using Karamja gloves to deposit karambwans, teleporting to the Ardougne Monastery with an Ardougne Cloak 1 or higher to use the fairy ring back takes roughly the same time as using the fairy ring to the Zanaris bank and back. So if the quest point cape is not unlocked, using the fairy ring to the Zanaris bank might be preferred as it requires less clicks.\n\nFor alternatives, see fastest access for banking, only a deposit box is necessary, and using Fairy Rings for fairy ring network access. \n\nTo increase yield, equip any Rada's blessing for a 2%/4%/6%/8% chance to double catch, which stacks additively with spirit flakes for an additional 50% chance to double catch. The fish barrel will increase trip duration and the ability to AFK. While below 99, a dragon harpoon special can boost Fishing and increase catch chance.\n\nAt perfect rates, with all the additional items, it is possible to catch between 450, at level 65 Fishing with no additional items, and 875 at level 99 with all additional items and very quick banking.",

At maximum efficiency and concentration, players are able to catch and process up to 260 eels per hour without tick manipulation.\n\nThese calculations are based on having level 99 Fishing, 96+ Cooking, and maintaining a moderate level of efficiency. Assuming the same intensity, a player with level 90 Fishing could expect to catch around 180 eels an hour. Given 96 Cooking, a sacred eel is worth  on average.\n\nOptionally, players may wield their highest available Rada's blessing for up to 8% chance of catching two eels at once. Similarly, players may opt to use Spirit flakes as they will increase the yield by 50%. Neither item provides additional Fishing experience, however, they will increase both profit and Cooking experience and can be stacked.\n\nWhile the addition of a Pearl fishing rod does not impact catch rate at maximum efficiency, it frees up an additional inventory slot and may be an option worth considering for players who want to reduce intensity. For players without the Pearl fishing rod, a Dragon harpoon can be equipped for use of its special attack, which temporarily boosts the player's Fishing level by 3. Lastly, pieces of the Angler's outfit may be equipped to gain up to 2.5% additional Fishing experience.\n\nWith 99 cooking, a chef's delight can be consumed to temporarily raise your level to 104, for 8 Zulrah's scales per cut on average instead of 7. To use this method, deposit the sacred eels in the deposit chest in Zul-andra after a full inventory and cut them later in a bank. A fish barrel can make this more AFK but it isn't necessary. Once Cooking drains below 104, it needs to be reboosted; Preserve is recommended to lengthen the boost.

Using the Amulet of glory to teleport to Edgeville for banking, players can charge up to 27 orbs per trip (one inventory slot is needed for the cosmic runes), resulting in a maximum profit of  coins per trip.\n\nHowever, due to run energy depletion, it can be more worthwhile to withdraw 2 energy potion(4) and only charge 25 orbs per run. This method yields slightly lower profits per run ( coins), but enables higher overall hourly profit due to being able to constantly run. Each trip takes approximately 170 seconds, allowing 21 trips per hour. One trip uses about 75% energy (without weight-reducing clothing) and roughly 10% energy is recuperated (at level 1 agility) while charging the 25 orbs. Consume 6 or 7 doses of energy potion per trip, while running through the dungeon, and bank all leftover doses to be re-combined later.\n\nAlternatively, players with a Dust battlestaff and Revitalisation pool or better in their player-owned house may choose to sacrifice a single inventory slot and bring some Law runes to teleport to their house after each inventory of orbs is charged. This allows the player to use their house to refill run energy and teleport back to Edgeville through an Amulet of Glory (mounted), thus negating the need to recharge amulets or drink potions. Players who lack access to an amulet of glory may use a Ring of dueling to teleport to the Ferox Enclave to recharge and bank, then either use a Paddewwa teleport tablet to get to the Edgeville Dungeon or run through the Ferox Enclave Dungeon and use the Soul Wars Portal twice to get to Edgeville.\n\nIt is possible to speed up the trips by charging the orbs manually instead of automatically. To do this, hold the spacebar, click the Charge Air Orb spell as soon as it becomes available and on the second sound cue of the previous cast, click the Air Obelisk. Repeat until you have completed your inventory.\n\nThe Air Obelisk is located on an island in the Wilderness only accessible via Edgeville Dungeon.

There is also an extra gate you must pass through when taking the southern route. It is possible to gain up to 39,900 Magic experience per hour doing this, making it a notable training method. Players are able to gain moderate experience and profit at the same time.\n\nBear in mind that running through the Edgeville dungeon places you in combat range of aggressive thugs, chaos druids, deadly red spiders, skeletons, and black demons, so a good Defence level or food could help. Since it is in the Wilderness, players should not take anything they are not prepared to lose.

    "details": "Killing blue dragons map.pngTaverley Dungeon map.png\nWater orbs are worth coins, and they are created by casting Charge Water Orb on unpowered orbs at the Water Obelisk. With a mist battlestaff equipped, this requires three cosmic runes per cast (or  coins). Using Falador Teleport for banking, players can charge 26 orbs per trip (the other two inventory slots being used for law and cosmic runes), resulting in a profit of  coins per trip. Using a rune pouch to hold both cosmic and law runes in a single inventory slot will let you charge an extra orb each trip, slightly increasing this method's profitability. \n\nIt is possible to speed up the trips by charging the orbs manually instead of automatically. To do this, hold the spacebar, click the Charge Water Orb spell as soon as it becomes available and on the second sound cue of the previous cast, click the Water Obelisk. Repeat until you have completed your inventory.\n\nThe Water Obelisk is located in the Taverley Dungeon. Using the map on the right as a guide through the dungeon, the round trip to the obelisk, counting banking, takes approximately 185 seconds using the 80 Agility shortcut, 205 seconds using the 70 Agility shortcut, or 325 seconds without any shortcuts.\n\nBear in mind that running through the Taverley Dungeon places you in combat range of aggressive black demons, hellhounds, poison spiders, and black dragons. A good Defence level is recommended. Also, having some antipoison in your bank lets you quickly cure any poison in between trips.\n\nAssuming the unpowered orbs and cosmic runes are purchased, you can make around 505 water orbs an hour using the level 80 Agility shortcut ( coins), 450 water orbs using the level 70 Agility shortcut ( coins), and 280 water orbs using no shortcuts ( coins).",

Since ashes are worth coins each, collecting them after Firemaking can be a good way to make money in free-to-play as well as gaining significant Firemaking experience. Maple logs ( each) yield more profit but willow logs ( each) may be used too if one has not reached level 45 firemaking yet. The best location to make fires is somewhere near a bank with few other players nearby.\n\nWithdraw 27 logs, start at the east end of the area, and make one long line of fires. Withdraw another 27 logs and make a second line the same way. By the time you're finished, the first line of fires should have mostly burned out, leaving ashes in their place. At this point, withdraw 27 more logs and run to the beginning of your original line of fires.\n\nClick first to collect the ashes, and quickly light a fire. If you have done this correctly and quickly, your character will not hesitate and immediately light a fire. Continue this down the entire line, until you reach the end and you should have 27 ashes in your inventory. Bank the ashes and do the exact same thing with the second line of fires. Do this repeatedly, making fires over the old lines and picking up ashes. In general, ashes will disappear about three minutes after the fire goes out, so you have a decent amount of time to pick them up.",

Completing the Hard Morytania diary doubles the amount of fungi collected, (Morytania legs do not have to be worn). Casting Bloom affects rotting objects in the eight squares around the player and consumes between 1 and 6 Prayer points.\n\nThe best location has 4 logs and is slightly north of Ver Sinhaza, however it requires [[A Taste of Hope]] to travel there quickly. While there are other 4 log spots, they are very far away from teleports and as such, the next best option for overall collection speed is 3 logs slightly south-east of fairy ring . Both locations are shown in images on the right.\n\nIf using the location north of Ver Sinhaza, you can bank at Ferox Enclave with a ring of dueling and restore Prayer points at either the pool of refreshment or by simply entering the free-for-all portal (this won't restore your Prayer points until you leave the portal, which includes the teleporting mentioned next). You can then teleport back by using a Drakan's medallion to teleport to Ver Sinhaza, run east, and then run north through the small opening next to the stream.\n\nIf using the location next to the fairy ring, you can bank at Castle Wars with a ring of dueling and restore Prayer points at either your own player-owned house's rejuvenation pool (or any tier pool above rejuvenation) or in house party worlds 330, 465, or 512. You can then teleport back to fairy ring using a fairy ring in a player-owned house. If you lack the requirements for your own fairy ring or rejuvenation pool in your own player-owned house and cannot use another player's player-owned house, you can use an Ardougne cloak 1 to teleport to the Ardougne Monastery to restore your Prayer points, and then run east past the Tower of Life to use the fairy ring there to teleport back to fairy ring .\n\nWith the Hard Karamja diary complete, if you have sufficient prayer points to return to the fungi location without restoring prayer, you can use Karamja gloves 3 to use the bank deposit chest at the gem mine. This bank chest is closer to the teleport destination than other methods.\n\nWhen using 4 logs, you will almost always fill your inventory without running out of Prayer points by level 60 Prayer, see the graph below for the chance of obtaining a full inventory without Prayer restore at various other levels and number of logs. If you have a low Prayer level, you should bring a Prayer potion or two.\n\nIf the location you choose has one, you should always pick from a log directly north of the tile you cast Bloom on last because when picked, you will path back to the Bloom tile automatically, removing the need to click to walk back yourself.\n\nMort myre fungi monte carlo.png",

This is the area north-west of the entrance of the Varrock Sewers, just south of Bryophyta's lair. For free-to-play players, this is the farthest area reached in the Varrock Sewers. \n\nAs the sewer is a multi-combat area, and the deadly red spiders are aggressive, players with a combat level lower than 69 can get attacked by multiple spiders at a time, so having food is recommended. The deadly red spiders are found immediately after reaching the end of the sewer tunnel going east-west. Since this area is secluded off and only reached after slashing through a spider's web, a slash weapon (any cheap scimitar or sword) or a knife will be required to slash through to get to the eggs. If the player chooses to bring an air staff for the Varrock Teleport method, the slash item will have to be dropped every run. If not, the player can keep their slash weapon equipped to save an inventory slot.\n\nThe eggs will spawn roughly every 42 seconds at the southernmost part of the sewer. There are multiple aggressive deadly red spiders and moss giants, which can be safespotted (which allows players to be out of combat to switch worlds). To collect the eggs, the player will need to come out of the safespot.\n\nThe route:\n*Take out 2.5 energy potions, law and fire runes, food if low level, and a disposable slash item from the bank.\n*Head to the manhole at the eastern exit of Varrock Palace.\n*Navigate through the sewers until the web is reached.\n*Slash the web, and drop the slash item.\n*Pick up all the red spider eggs, then (if the player does not have a Combat level of 69+, find a safespot and) switch worlds.\n*Repeat until full, then teleport back to Varrock, and bank the yield.\nIt is recommended that players bank the eggs in the eastern Varrock bank until the player is satisfied with the amount of eggs collected, and then sell them.\n*Without the use of any teleports, a run starting and ending in the Varrock bank to the eggs in the sewers will take anywhere from 10-12 minutes.\n*Using the chronicle (obtained from Diango in Draynor Village) makes a single run take about 7-9 minutes.\n**This also allows for wielding of the slash weapon, and removes the need to bring the staff or runes, at the cost of slightly more running.\n*Using the Varrock Teleport spell and collecting an inventory of 26 eggs also makes a single run take 7-9 minutes.\n*With world hopping at 69+ combat, one inventory can be done in as little as 3.5 minutes, producing upwards of 445+ eggs per hour.",

They spawn on two tables in the Chaos Temple, which is located north-west of Goblin Village, guarded by Monks of Zamorak. Wine of Zamorak can be taken from the table downstairs, which will cause the monks to attack you, even when you use the Telekinetic Grab spell. However, a table with a second Wine of Zamorak spawn can be accessed by climbing up the ladder by the entrance, which can be taken safely by use of the Telekinetic Grab spell. Climbing the ladder requires you to have a total level of 500 while wearing a set of Zamorak robes.\n\nWield a staff of air (any staff that grants unlimited air runes works) and Zamorak robes. Your inventory should consist of 53 law runes, 8 cakes, a single restore potion, and a looting bag. (Members may eschew the cakes and restore potions by using rings of dueling, and using the Pool of Refreshment at the Ferox Enclave. This can also work as your banking teleport). Enter the Chaos Temple by walking north from Falador; members can use games necklaces to go to Burthorpe and utilise a shortcut unlocked by the easy Falador Diary to get there faster. Climb the ladder and use Telekinetic Grab on the wine on the table, then climb back down the ladder. Use Telekinetic Grab once more on the wine across the room to quickly grab the other Wine of Zamorak. Once you get the Wine of Zamorak, quickly go up the ladder. Wait for the first wine to respawn, then repeat the process. Be careful, as the monks' attacks can drain your combat stats and health quickly. Eat as needed and use a dose of your potion if your magic stat gets too low to cast Telekinetic Grab. Both wines will respawn 25 seconds after they are taken. Once you have a full inventory, enter the Wilderness just to the north and fill your looting bag to its maximum capacity. Resume grabbing wines until your inventory is full again, then use your closest bank teleport, or closest free-to-play bank, to store your wine. It is recommended to drop excess restore potions and cakes you didn't use to make more room for wine. You can do a run of 53 wines in 15 minutes with the looting bag, or 204 per hour, for a profit of . If you walk between Falador west bank and the Chaos Temple (Asgarnia), you can collect 192 wines per hour with the looting bag, for a profit of . \n\nOn free-to-play worlds, both spawns may be crowded. You can either switch worlds until you find an empty temple, or compete with the other players to get the wine first, although competing will likely cause both players' profit per hour to drop. If competing, note that whether players standing on the same spot are clickable depends on your own orientation. Telegrabbing the wine will make you face the table, and your staff will hover over the table, making it much easier to misclick on a player.",

The profit also assumes Mimics are activated and defeated on the first attempt.\n\nCremating urium remains, collecting the keys and opening the Gold Chests in the Shade Catacombs gives on average one elite clue every 35 minutes, in addition to other standard loot (mostly coins and alchables). It also gives a decent amount of Firemaking and Prayer experience, and chances at the Zealot's robes, which are useful for training Prayer.\n\nFor free transportation, Morytania legs 3 or better is the best way to get to Mort'ton regularly. Mort'ton teleports are also an option, but at  each they are fairly expensive and will reduce the hourly profit by a lot, for only 20 or so seconds saved per trip. The minigame teleport to shades of mort'ton is also a good option, but has a cooldown timer of 30 minutes.\n\nTo cremate the shades, fill up the gold coffin with 28 urium remains and fill the rest of the inventory with redwood pyre logs and a tinderbox. Use the logs and remains on the pyre and light it, collecting the reward (either coins or a gold key) from the pedestal. You can stack up multiple rewards on the pedestal to save time, but coins will disappear after 30 seconds, and keys will disappear after 2 minutes. Tick manipulation methods can be used to slightly increase the speed the shades are cremated, up to around 400 cremations + loots per hour, or 600 cremations without chests. This is heavily decreased by completing the elite clues you gather.\n\nYou can either bank the keys or go open chests directly from there. They are about the same overall speed, although saving up keys can lead to more efficient chest opening because you won't have to switch chest types as often and instead of running a partial inventory of keys while getting coin drops, more keys can be used in one run.\n\nEither way, enter the Shade Catacombs, go through the gold door, and start opening chests. Each loot will give coins, swamp paste, and one other item – none of them are incredibly valuable (besides the elite clue), but they all add up to make each chest well over  on average.",

Using the Moonclan Teleport (requiring 69 Magic), a round trip from the Lunar Isle bank to the Astral Altar takes about 49 seconds, including banking and filling up essence pouches, allowing 73 trips per hour to be made. To start out, players should withdraw a full inventory's worth of pure essence from the bank, and then fill their pouch(es) with the remaining essence; this should come out to 66 essence per trip if utilizing the colossal essence pouch and rune pouch. Next, run outside heading south and then east past the Suqahs, trying to avoid being hit. With 43 Prayer, you can flick protect from melee to avoid taking any damage or losing any prayer points as you run past them. Otherwise, you may have to consume food or prayer potions occasionally, reducing profit per hour slightly. Once at the Astral Altar, craft your runes and use the moonclan teleport to bank, repeating the whole process. Using a crafting cape to bank at the crafting guild may potentially be slightly faster, however it is unlikely to increase profit if it takes up an inventory slot that could be used to carry essence instead, and wearing a weight-reducing cape is likely to be better.\n \nIf not wearing a Runecrafting cape, you should use the NPC Contact spell to contact the Dark mage to repair your essence pouch(es) whenever they degrade. If using a rune pouch, you should store law, cosmic, and astral runes inside it, which along with a dust battlestaff, will cover your teleports to bank as well as your contact spells to repair pouches. If not using a rune pouch, you should either carry law runes or moonclan teleport tablets to cover your teleports to bank, keeping cosmic runes in the bank and withdrawing one each time you need to repair your essence pouch(es). Using teleport tablets is slightly less click-intensive, however it will likely lower your profit per hour. The current difference in profit per hour is \n \nWhile wearing the recommended clothing, each trip will deplete your stamina by approximately 40%, so drink a 2-dose stamina potion while filling essence pouches at the bank (completion of Alfred Grimhand's Barcrawl will allow you to automatically destroy the empty vial upon finishing the potion). Slower alternatives are teleporting to Nardah with desert amulet 4 and praying at the Elidinis Statuette, using a Teleport to House tab or Spellbook Swap to drink from your Revitalisation pool, or using the Pool of Refreshment located in the Ferox Enclave via a ring of dueling. Depending on the cost of stamina potions and how quickly you are able to perform these alternatives, it may be possible for them to be more profitable.",

Inside the Abyss, the creatures there will be aggressive and might do fair amounts of damage. See Abyss for more information on how to navigate the Abyss. Once inside, enter the blood rift and craft the essence in your inventory and your pouches. Teleport back to Edgeville with an amulet of glory and repeat.\n\nWearing a full set of Raiments of the Eye grants the player 60% additional runes when crafting blood runes, adding to the profit made from this method. No additional experience is gained, however.\n\nA ring of dueling is optional, but it helps in case players forget to swap out an exhausted glory for a charged one. Using Charge dragonstone jewellery scroll to recharge your amulets is recommended as it is quick, allowing you to spend more time runecrafting.\n\nThe achievement diary cape is especially useful for runecrafting in the Abyss if the player has one. Teleport to Jarr at Shantay Pass for banking, then to the Lesser Fanatic to quickly reach the Abyss. Since an amulet of glory isn't needed for this method, the player could instead opt to wear a Desert amulet 4 and teleport to Nardah when necessary to replenish run energy hitpoints without the need for stamina potions and food.",

    "details": "Cosmic Altar route.png\nDepending on the method of travel, a round trip to the Cosmic Altar takes about a minute and a half to two minutes, including banking and filling up essence pouches. To start out, players should withdraw a full inventory's worth of pure essence from the bank, and then fill their pouches with the remaining essence; this should come out to 54 essence per trip if utilising all four pouches, which will have to be repaired by use of the NPC Contact spell (67 Magic) to contact the Dark mage as they degrade. At the bare minimum, profits can get as low as assuming 810 essence is bought and then crafted per hour.\n\nUsing the Slayer ring and fairy rings, you can make about 40 trips to the Cosmic Altar per hour. With 59 Runecraft (giving double cosmic runes) and especially 75 Runecraft (giving access to the giant pouch), this can be highly profitable. Start out at the Edgeville bank. Unload pure essence and store it in your pouches, and then take out essence for your inventory. Teleport via the slayer ring to Rellekka Slayer Caves, exit, and use the fairy ring to the west to teleport to Zanaris. From there, run south to the Agility shortcut; if you have 66 Agility, go through both of them, although you may get stuck and take a small amount of damage before passing through. Run further south and enter the mysterious ruins, and then go directly to the altar. Craft your essence in your inventory and pouches, and then teleport back to Edgeville with your amulet of glory. With this method, you can craft about 2,160 essence per hour. Without the giant pouch, that will drop to about 1,680.\n\nAlternatively, a quest point cape or necklace of passage (Wizards' Tower teleport) can be used to access fairy rings after banking in Edgeville.\n\nPlayers with 80 Construction can use a fairy ring in their house for transport to Zanaris, in excess of 45 trips per hour are achievable when using this option. To begin the player will need to build a fairy ring, Lunar altar, and Revitalisation pool or greater in their POH; a basic jewellery box or greater is also useful but optional. Additionally, a rune pouch filled with law, astral, and dust runes will save inventory space. Once the runes have been crafted, use an equipped ring of dueling to bank at Castle Wars before casting Teleport to House and use your fairy ring to travel Zanaris, refilling run energy at your revitalisation pool as needed. The lunar altar will allow swapping to the Lunar spellbook briefly to cast NPC Contact when essence pouches need repairing, remember to switch back to the normal spellbook with the altar again afterwards. This method can return  at 75 Runecraft assuming 2385 essence is bought and crafted per hour.",

You need to recharge your pouches every nine trips at the Dark mage to prevent the giant pouch from degrading.\n\nUsing the small through giant essence pouches, you can hold up to 54 essence per trip, resulting in a profit of coins per trip (ignoring other expenses). This assumes at least level  for the giant pouch.

Instead of buying more amulets of glory, the player has a number of options when it comes to re-charging glories; Glories can be recharged at the Fountain of Heroes in the Heroes' Guild located between Taverley and Burthorpe, secondly is to recharge the amulets at the Fountain of Rune. Thirdly is for players who have completed Dragon Slayer II, the Fountain of Uhld in the Myths' Guild is the easiest to access. It should be noted that recharging at the Fountain of Heroes and Fountain of Uhld will give each amulet 4 charges, while recharging at the Fountain of Rune will give each amulet 6 charges. And lastly, the player can use a Charge dragonstone jewellery scroll as they are quite cheap to buy should the player want to save time or if the player has not completed any of the above quests. The scroll will only re-charge the glories with 4 charges.",

If the player is maxed, the max cape can be equipped for the same effect as the runecraft cape, and also provides quick banking to the Crafting Guild.\n\n\nPlayers without a runecraft cape will follow the same route, however they will need to recharge their pouch every seven trips by using NPC Contact, to prevent the pouch from degrading. \n\nIt is worth noting that getting 96 trips per hour is a very high intensity activity requiring near perfect banking and for the wrath runes to be crafted perfectly as well. A more reasonable trip time would be ~45 seconds. Recharging your pouch and restoring health points will also contribute to a lower trip rate. It could be more relevant to expect to make between 75 and 80 trips per hour instead if not performing optimally. This results in a profit of approximately  and .\n\n\nAn alternative bank teleport option includes using the achievement diary cape. Teleport to Jarr at Shantay Pass for banking, as well as to the Lesser Fanatic to quickly reach the Dark mage in the Abyss to repair the pouch. Since an amulet of glory isn't needed for this method, the player could instead opt to wear a Desert amulet 4 and teleport to Nardah when necessary to recharge run and replenish Prayer and Hitpoints without the need for stamina potions.",

Clue scrolls take additional time to complete and are not included in the profit calculation.\n\nCremating urium remains, collecting the keys and opening the Gold Chests in the Shade Catacombs, rewards a large number of coins and alchable items as well as a decent amount of Firemaking and Prayer experience. Chests can also reward pieces of the Zealot's robes, which is the Prayer skilling outfit.\n\nPlayers interested in clues can expect roughly one elite clue every 35 minutes. If you are very quick at completing clues this can be more profitable. For a guide that factors in the time to complete those clues see Money_making_guide/Completing elite clues (urium remains)\n\nFor free transportation, Morytania legs 3 or better is the best way to get to Mort'ton regularly. Mort'ton teleports are also an option, but at each they are fairly expensive and will reduce the hourly profit by a lot, for only 20 or so seconds saved per trip.\n\nTo cremate the shades, fill up the gold coffin with 28 urium remains and fill the rest of the inventory with redwood pyre logs and a tinderbox. Use the logs and remains on the pyre and light it, collecting the reward (either coins or a gold key) from the pedestal. You can stack up multiple rewards on the pedestal to save time, but the loot will disappear after 5 minutes. Tick manipulation methods can be used to slightly increase the speed the shades are cremated, up to around 400 cremations + loots per hour, or 600 cremations without chests.\n\nYou can either bank the keys or go open chests directly from there. They are about the same overall speed, although saving up keys can lead to more efficient chest opening because you won't have to switch chest types as often and instead of running a partial inventory of keys while getting coin drops, more keys can be used in one run. Either way, enter the Shade Catacombs, go through the gold door, and start opening chests. Each loot will give coins, swamp paste, and one other item – none of them are incredibly valuable (besides the elite clue), but they all add up to make each chest well over  on average.",

This will save time and reduce the amount of movement with the mouse.

Players must choose whether or not to actively chase fish shoals to speed up the process. A merfolk trident or trident of the seas increase the chance of scaring fish shoals into the net.\n\nOnce ten fish shoals get stuck in the trap, the net becomes full, and must be checked. This yields ten raw fish, destroying the drift net in the process. The fish can be banked in the interface for 5 numulite each.\n\nCeto must be spoken to in order to enter the activity, located just north of the anchor rope. 200 numulites can be paid to gain access for a full day or 20,000 numulites can be paid to gain permanent access.\n\nAnnette, located in the underwater area, will store up to 2,000 drift nets.",

    "details": "Headless arrows are made by using feathers on arrow shafts, and they are used in Fletching to create arrows for quick experience gains. Because most fletchers will not create the headless arrows on their own, there is an opportunity for low-level players to make a fair amount of profit (and decent experience) by fletching headless arrows.\n\nTo start with, test the profit of making one headless arrow; buy one feather and one arrow shaft from the Grand Exchange, make a headless arrow, and sell it. If the profit is less than 10, there may be better options to make money. If it is higher, buy up feathers and arrow shafts in bulk.\n\nTo create headless arrows, use the feathers on the arrow shafts. A menu will open asking how many you want to make; click all, which will make 10 sets of 15 headless arrows. Each set of 150 takes about 12 seconds, so you can make more than 40,000 headless arrows per hour if you have enough materials. However, feathers have a buying limit of 30,000 every four hours, while arrow shafts have a buying limit of 7,000 every four hours, so you can only buy about 15 minutes worth of headless arrow materials per four hours. It may be useful to put in an overnight offer for feathers and arrow shafts if you have enough money to start with. You can buy more feathers at fishing shops in feather packs.\n\nBecause making headless arrows does not require banking and only takes up three inventory spaces, it can be used in conjunction with other money-making methods where there is a long wait between actions. This includes collecting cave nightshade, cave goblin wire, and potato cactus.",

Detailed information on the best items to use is provided in the strategy guide. It is in fact encouraged, as most smithed items have a buy limit of 125, and it is therefore not possible to play Giants' Foundry for more than an hour or so without combining item types of a given metal. The additional expense is negligible.\n\nIn the Giants' Foundry, the player forges giant swords for a Hill Giant named Kovac. The player supplies a full inventory's worth of metal, and is given a lump sum of gold and Foundry Reputation for each sword. It is a minigame where due care and attention must be paid to the forging process, but the click-rate is very low; much of the gameplay is merely observation and a little timing. Still, the actual earning rates the player will experience are highly dependent on a multitude of factors: Expenses, player performance, and the commissions are assigned at random, so the reward for each sword will vary.\n\nThe crucible where the metal is inserted accepts not only bars, but also smithed items, which are worth one less bar than what is required to smith it. This can be used to significantly cut expenses. If a platebody is currently being recommended, keep in mind 14 bars' worth of each metal is needed, but each platebody provides 4, and so the player will be 2 short. Another platebody may be added, but this will waste the other two bars, so it is recommended to either add bars or have a small stock of another item to chip in the remainder.\n\nAlloys are always recommended, as they further cheapen expenses and can only improve earning rates (so long as it's only two metals). The Iron-Steel alloy has been chosen for this guide as it provides the highest profit per hour consistently. Higher-tiered alloys trade profit rates for experience rates. Detailed information about earning rates for different alloys is once again in the strategy guide.\n\nWhile the Iron-Steel alloy only requires Smithing level 30 to use, the moulds in which the swords are cast may have their own level requirements. In order to even begin using any of the purchasable moulds, level 50 is required, while level 81 is needed to have all moulds available. Without them, or with only some available, profit rates will be similar to what is depicted in this guide. As the moulds are unlocked and the player becomes eligible to use them (with skill boosts or without), the profit will increase up to 50%. The effect is even more pronounced with higher-tiered alloys, making even Mithril-Adamant economically viable along with its very good experience rate. The strategy guide details earning rates for most optimal alloys.",

If the player is still learning floor 5 or is not yet click perfect, a hallowed token (worth 10 hallowed marks) can be used to grant 1 extra minute of time. This will decrease profitability by per token (likely one per run).\n\nThe Hallowed Sepulchre is a solo Agility activity in Darkmeyer in which the player avoids obstacles to reach the Grand Hallowed Coffin and loot other coffins before time runs out. The activity becomes highly profitable at 92 agility, as this allows players to loot floor 5, where the ring of endurance can be obtained. Due to the high proportion of profit allocated to the ring drop, actual profit will be influenced largely by player luck. Other notable frequent high-value drops are ranarr seeds, sanfew serums, runite bolts, and blood runes.\n\n* Once comfortable with the final floors a hallowed token can be used to ensure the player can loot all chests on floors 2 and 3 in addition to 4 and 5. It is recommended to bring three vampyre dust per run and 6 mahogany planks. If click perfect, this can be achieved without a hallowed token. \n\n* Looting all chests from floors 2-5 (including the Grand Hallowed Coffin) without a token will yield an average of  per run including the Ring of endurance and  without the Ring of endurance. This is compared against an average of  per run including the Ring of endurance and  without the Ring of endurance for completing just floors 4 and 5 [an increase of /run or approximately /hr at 6 laps per hour].\n\nNote that if the player is planning on training Construction using mahogany planks normally, it is recommended to continue using them here as the gp/xp of using the planks to repair bridges is superior to using them normally.",

The elusive Dragon impling at Impetuous Impulses or throughout Gielinor is exceedingly rare, but it is valuable and worth .\n\nPlayers can reach Puro-Puro by travelling to Lumbridge Swamp and entering the Lost City shed with a Dramen or Lunar staff equipped. Alternatively, they can use a Fairy ring if sufficient progress in Fairytale II - Cure a Queen has been made. Unlike the permanent crop circle in Zanaris, there are other crop circles that periodically spawn in wheat fields throughout Gielinor.\n\nAfter entering the crop circle to access Puro-Puro, players could begin in the south-east or north-west corner and work the maze. Moreover, players are advised to always save nine jars so they can trade them for an inventory full of jars; otherwise, stock up on low-level implings and exchange them for a jar generator from Elnock Inquisitor.\n\nAround 1-4 dragon implings could be caught on a good hour, which could set the profit margin between and . Most likely, however, players will be fortunate enough to catch at least one an hour, so it is advised that they also catch nature, magpie, and ninja implings while hunting for dragon imps in order to sustain profitability.",

Unless you have a high magic level and can hit hard and often, melee is recommended as ankou tend to hit hard, so defensive equipment such as rune armour is mostly recommended. The same goes with range, since ankou hit hard it is recommended to go range if you have a high range level.\n\nIt is recommended to go with rune armour or with green armour and reach and magic skills. \nThere are safe-spots located in the room, but this requires ankou to not have aggro on you as they can roam behind the safespot and attack you.\n\nConsumables\n\nTry to bring as much food as you can, to prolong the amount of time you can farm ankou. Tuna is a popular option as it is cheap, but players can opt to use lobsters, swordfish, or anchovy pizzas.\n\nIf you are using melee, you can bring a strength potion to raise your max hit.\n\nAnkou (Stronghold of Security) safespots.png",

The profit rate assumes kills per hour, per king. Your actual profits may be higher or lower depending on your speed and luck.\n\nAs long as a player can consistently kill 2 kings before the third one respawns (requiring a minimum average dps of 5.6 against all 3 kings, but realistically closer to 7 or 8 to allow for time picking up loot, switching gear, etc.), it becomes possible to stay for extremely long trips, especially when using the Saradomin Godsword special attack combined with the Lightbearer ring, with the main limitation being poison protection and prayer points. The respawn timer makes it impossible to spend less than 45 seconds per kill in the long run, or 135 seconds per cycle. This puts an upper limit of 26.6 kills (of all 3 kings) per hour, but the actual kills per hour will vary depending on trip length, because getting to the dungeon takes so long. This guide assumes one trip per hour and approximately 10 minutes to bank, return, and set up the loop. \n\nBecause of time needed to get there, maximizing trip length is critical to maximizing profit: better supplies and fewer switches are worthwhile if they mean longer stays. Flicking Rigour and Piety can conserve prayer points, further extending trips. If not on task, the Serpentine helm provides immunity to poison. Additionally, loot management is critical. Bring runes for High Level Alchemy, and profit will be noticeably lower without the Fremennik Elite Diary completed. \n\nTo avoid taking significant damage while getting there, it is important to pray the correct prayers when running through Waterbirth Island Dungeon. What to pray and when can be seen in the pictures listed.\n\nMore information on how to set up the cycle can be found at Dagannoth Kings/Strategies. Players used to only killing Dagannoth Rex can also opt to start the cycle by sneaking around the south of the island and safespotting Rex, then running north to kill Dagannoth Prime with ranged, then kill Dagannoth Supreme with Melee. More confident players can opt to kill Supreme first and flick Prime if he attacks.",

The dust should be picked up after every kill. Drops such as coins, herbs (unless ranarr), and seeds should be ignored. Feral vampyres do have a chance to lower your strength by 1 if they hit; Drinking a strength potion will easily counter this effect.\n\nMid level players can expect ~200 kills per hour. Higher level players can expect ~250 & Maxed players ~300+. Efaritay's aid can be worn to gain a 10% damage bonus against feral vampyres, although the upkeep cost of this ring will eat into profits.\n\nPlayers can bank their drops using the nearby bank in Burgh De Rott.

Your actual profits may be higher or lower depending on your speed and luck.\n\nK'ril Tsutsaroth can drop the Zamorak hilt, Zamorakian spear, Staff of the dead, and Steam battlestaff, and he and his minions can drop parts of the Godsword. Apart from his unique drops, K'ril also drops a good amount of runes, herbs, and seeds.\n\nLike the other generals in God Wars Dungeon, he can be reached either by using an ecumenical key or by killing 40 of his followers. This can take up to 10 minutes by killing imps, bloodvelds, and werewolves that are near the arena. When entering the dungeon, it is best that players get their kill count outside the dungeon and drain all their Prayer points before entering. This is because when players enter Zamorak's Fortress, all Prayer points are depleted upon entry. Once kill count is obtained, the player can enter the boss room.\n\nAt 80 Magic and above and wearing Karil's or (Zamorak) black d'hide armour, the player, who can also use Ranged instead and full Armadyl armour, can use Protect from Melee to block K'ril's powerful Melee attacks and will effectively tank the majority of his magical attacks. Also, the player should keep their Prayer points low to prevent losing too many when he executes his hit-through-prayer special attack that smites for one-half of the damage done and may hit up to 49, thus draining half of the current Prayer points. He will launch his special attack when he yells, \"YARRRRRRR!\"\n\nAlternatively, if the player is 90 Defence and above, they can wear Barrows or Bandos armour and use Protect from Magic while tanking K'ril's Melee attacks. This method will allow them to avoid his dangerous special attack and is only feasible for warriors and not archers since the latter needs Protect from Melee.\n\nOptimal kills per hour is achieved using a Twisted Bow or Bow of Faerdhinen with a kiting method, allowing players to avoid all damage from K'ril himself. With this strategy kills per hour of 26-30 can be achieved.\n\nAfter slaying K'ril, go after Balfrug Kreeyath and the other bodyguards. A solo trip can last upwards of around five kills per trip, and it takes around four minutes per kill including respawn time.",

    "details": "The listed profit rate assumes kills per hour, but up to 25 is possible with maxed stats and gear. Even higher kills per hour can be achieved by using magic during the melee phases. Your expected profit will vary depending on your kills per hour and luck on venator shard drops.\n\nFor overall boss strategy, please see the strategy page for Phantom Muspah.\n\n\n\n\nPhantom Muspah - stepback method.mp4\nBefore the fight starts, stand near the cave entrance and wait for the boss to spawn. Pray accordingly to which style the boss is currently using. Remember to summon thralls when your current one runs out of time. If using the melee step-back method, stand approximately 4 tiles east of the muspah's respawn point.\n\nRun back and kite the boss if it is using melee to prevent it from attacking you. If you're able to, you can avoid its melee attack entirely by use of the stepback method, which involves moving away from the boss one tick before its attack animation starts, as seen in the demonstration to the right. If the Muspah is moving while performing its melee attack and the player has Protect from Melee activated, it should always hit a 0.\n\nYour accuracy will be lower during the melee phases so you may want to sip a dose of stamina potion if your run energy runs low. A ring of endurance's passive effect will lower the rate at which your run energy drains and doubles the duration of stamina potion doses. However, there will be some kills where your special attack energy hasn't recharged enough to use the zaryte crossbow's special attack on the boss during the prayer shield phase if you don't wear a lightbearer.\n\nPhantom Muspah - lightning clouds safespot.png\nWhen the boss starts teleporting around the arena, there is a square near the centre in the south-west corner where you can stand to avoid all of the shadow orbs fired as well as being able to keep attacking the boss without being dragged out.\n\nDuring the prayer shield phase, cast Greater Corruption. This applies corruption to the boss which can help with removing its shield if you aren't comfortable with flicking Smite. Equip your crossbow and sapphire bolts (e) and proceed to attack the boss, using your special attack to proc the sapphire special effect and praying accordingly. Once the shield drops, re-equip your twisted bow and finish it off.\n\nYou should use roughly 4 doses of prayer/super restore potion per kill, 1 dose of range/bastion potion and 1-3 food depending on mistakes and chip damage taken. You might also use a dose of stamina every 2-3 kills. Depending on supply drops, you can stay for trips of 15-20 kills, with kills averaging 2:10 mins and the 30 second respawn timer, you should expect to get 20-25 kills per hour roughly.",

Your actual profits may be higher or lower depending on your speed and luck.\n\n\n\n\nZulrah is a high level boss that requires relatively high combat stats and equipment to kill. Zulrah is commonly killed for its profitability due to its consistent drops averaging about  per kill. At higher levels, it is possible to maintain 24 kills per hour with high concentration or using a Twisted bow as the primary weapon, at an average of two minutes per kill and approximately 30 seconds of banking, which in turn, increases gp per hour to about  (not including cost of supplies). With maximum stats and gear, upwards of 35 kills per hour can be achieved, resulting in  gp per hour before supplies.\n\nTypical gear includes the use of Void Knight equipment especially when ranging. Ahrim's robes prove to be better than Void mage due to Ahrim's higher magical accuracy. However, void mage will suffice and are recommended to those who wish to switch less between gear during the fight.\n\n;Basic strategy\n\n*When Zulrah is green, it attacks with Ranged, spreads toxic fumes over the area, and spawns snakelings who appear in the arena via white orbs.

This phase appears identical to the green phase. Alternate between  and  prayers.",

Alternatively, Guthan's set can be used for healing.\n\nAlthough this is also a free-to-play monster, it is not recommended to kill them on free-to-play because players will drastically limit their profitability, due to the fact that the best money-making items (Blood and Death runes) do not drop. Also, the strongest equipment players can use is Rune armour and weapons. Nonetheless, they could still be safespotted with Ranged or Magic. A commonly used safespot is located in the most southern large room behind the two skeletons by the east door, as it is the most protected location on the floor.\n\nEven though they can be found in the Wilderness (The Forgotten Cemetery) for the addition of dark fishing bait, it is not recommended to kill them there due to other nearby aggressive creatures and the location being in moderately deep Wilderness.",

The best method of banking is to teleport to Falador using a Falador teleport tablet, bank at Falador west bank, and return to the dungeon; use the shortcut in the western wall of the city (west of the west bank) and run north-west to the dungeon entrance. With 70 Agility, the Agility shortcut to the blue dragon area may be used, and running from the Falador west bank to this area of the dungeon only takes a couple of minutes. The shortcut can be used at 65 Agility, but will require the use of summer pies to boost to 70 Agility. Having at least 65 Agility is recommended to use the pipe shortcut; it is very time consuming to run around the dungeon and will require the player to bring the dusty key, which will greatly reduce kills per hour. Kills per hour may be maximised by picking up drops in rotation, as it takes a second or two for each dragon's drops to appear after being killed.",

    "details": "Level 2 cows in Lumbridge have 8 Hitpoints and always drop cowhide. Using any decent weapon, players are fairly likely to kill them in one hit. The recommended place to kill cows is at the Lumbridge cow field. It is most efficient to kill one cow, then another, and then loot the first cow's hide. This is faster than waiting for the first one to die. Once you have 27 cowhide, travel to Ellis in north-western Al Kharid (completion of the Prince Ali Rescue quest is recommended so that players do not have to pay to travel between Lumbridge and Al Kharid), who will tan them into hard leather for 3 coins each. Run further south to the Al Kharid bank, bank the leather, run back to the cow field, and repeat.\n\nThe attack speed of the player's weapon will be the main factor determining the player's kills per hour – a level 20 player with a mithril scimitar will kill them nearly as fast as a player with high level equipment. Players should be able to fairly consistently get over 300 cowhide (and thus hard leather) per hour.\n\nFor players who intend to use either Magic or Ranged, it is highly recommended to equip a weapon with decent accuracy that minimises ammunition use (e.g. air battlestaff, willow shortbow).\n\nAt times, it may be better to make soft leather instead – hard leather is worth, while soft leather is worth .\n\nPlayers can also farm the raw beef from the cows. The beef can be cooked into sinew for three Cooking experience each, then wound into crossbow strings for 15 Crafting experience each and sold on the Grand Exchange for coins each. The Lumbridge castle has a range, spinning wheel, and bank in it, making it possible to farm up to 100-200 strings per hour whilst also getting multiple kinds of experience.\n\nAlternatively one could kill cows and collect their hides at Falador farm, bank the hides in Falador bank, then when enough hides are collected make the trip to Ellis.\n\nAdditionally, if a player is not interested in tanning hides, it is at times equally profitable to kill cows, take their hide, bones, and raw beef, and bank it at the Falador east bank. At higher attack/strength levels with a rune scimitar, roughly 25 trips per hour can be completed. Totally, the player could collect 250 hides, 225 bones, and 225 raw beef, which are worth , , and  respectively.",

Your actual profits may be higher or lower depending on your speed and luck.\n\n\n\nGreen dragons are monsters found in the Wilderness, always drop dragon bones and green dragonhide (along with various other chance drops), which sell for  and  respectively. This makes each kill worth  coins, thus offering the player the opportunity to make a good amount of money by killing them and picking up their drops. Note that green dragons are not located in any non-PvP areas except the Myths' Guild basement. So, players should therefore only bring items that they are prepared to lose since there still are some player killers active around the zones where the green dragons are.\n\nThere are multiple locations to kill green dragons in the Wilderness. The location indicated on the map to the right can be reached by teleporting to the Bandit Camp using the burning amulet and running south-west. This location is a relatively safe place, since players may teleport without needing an amulet of glory (for locations in level 21-30 Wilderness), or the need to run south to level 20 Wilderness or less (using a teleport other than from dragonstone jewellery can only be done in level 20 Wilderness or below). If players get teleblocked, they have a greater chance of survival at this location, as there is a group of aggressive Dark Wizards just south of this Green Dragon \"crater.\" Players who get teleblocked and attacked by PKers can attempt to run south to the Dark Wizards, in the hopes that the Dark Wizards will steal the PKer's aggro, by attacking the player or the PKer.\n\n\nEach trip will require a few minutes to bank hides and bones and return to the green dragon location. Kills per hour can be maximised by picking up drops in rotation. It takes a couple of seconds for each dragon's drops to appear after being killed, so it is advisable to pick up the drops only after coming back to the same spot. Players should ensure that they have auto retaliate toggled on so that they do not accidentally waste time. Use of a looting bag is also advised.\n\nPlayers who have completed the elite Wilderness Diary will automatically note all dragon bones received on dragon kills in the Wilderness. This will extend the possible length of trips, since a player could hold around 50 green dragon hides in their inventory and looting bag, and just use 1 slot for dragon bones. This, of course, increases players' risk, since they will be holding twice as much loot.",

The spot to kill them is very crowded throughout most of the day, so it is recommended to hop between a few worlds to find one that is rather empty. Hill giants are aggressive towards players lower than 57 combat level, so killing them at lower levels would allow for more downtime between having to check the screen.\n\nThey can be safe-spotted by using range or magic, but using melee is more optimal to save on supplies used in terms of ammo or runes. Hill giants have slow attacks that rarely hit and barely any food will be required with rune armour. One tuna per trip would provide enough healing to last the entire trip.\n\nPlayers may choose to ignore big bones drops, which will lead to more experience per hour, but less profit overall.\n\nHill giants also drop beginner clue scrolls and giant keys, the latter can be used to take on Obor, which commonly drops rune items and provides a big chunk of profit, when you get it (50+ combat stats are recommended to fight Obor).\n\nAt higher levels (above 80 in melee stats), it is possible to kill around 400 Hill giants per hour with maximum concentration. This would yield around 3 giant keys per hour on average. With high defence armour and offensive gear, it is possible to kill these giants without any food or prayer continually, yielding over 50,000 melee experience per hour.\n\nIt is not recommended to pick up armour and weapon drops, but profits can be increased by picking up drops left by other players (like runes and limpwurt roots).",

Your actual profits may be higher or lower depending on your speed and luck.\n\nKilling ice troll runts is another good money-making method that is not very well known, and it only requires the completion of The Fremennik Trials and base 60 Melee stats, or around 60 Ranged, although good Magic stats would probably be best since ice troll runts' weakness is fire spells. They are only level 74, but do not underestimate them as they can hit up to 15 damage accurately, even through good armour (similar to Verac the Defiled; however, they cannot hit through Prayer).\n\nThe main reason it is suggested to kill them is because the Honour guards nearby will slaughter them, and if you land a single hit, you will receive the drops, which consist of rune kiteshields, rune warhammers, and even the granite shield. There's a great cannon spot across the bridge north-east from the city by the nearby arctic pine tree. They also drop decent amounts of nature runes, law runes, and raw sharks as well as herbs and seeds, but the most notable ones are the grimy ranarr weed and the ranarr seed. Many items in their drop table such as coal and balls of wool drop as notes, which can be added up to make a decent profit as well. A whole inventory of their uncommon to rare drops can range from 70,000 to 700,000 coins or more depending on how lucky you are.",

You may get up to 120 kills per hour with max combat stats\n\nLava dragons reside on their isle in level 36–42 Wilderness. A successful kill can take roughly 30 to 60 seconds. They are one of the most lucrative sources of income for high-level players if players can survive being intercepted and interrupted by PK clans. Aside from the dangers involved, willing players can travel there and safespot the dragons, and loot can also be telegrabbed from outside if the player chooses not to enter. Additionally, it is not recommended to go anywhere near them since they can easily kill you with their dragonfire breath if you chose a god book over the anti-dragon shield. You will have to bring items you are willing to risk, thus wearing only 3–4 items is strongly recommended. Anything else should be expendable and easily obtainable like a god cape, book, or Achievement Diary items. Magic bonuses are not required due to the low magic level of the dragons. Instead you should take Magic strength gear and the rest of your set up as tanking gear, for example an occult necklace, imbued god cape, and your weapon as your three risk slot items, with black d'hide body and black d'hide chaps in order to tank pkers.\nLava dragons are prone to Magic and water spells, so it's recommended to use them, but the Trident of the swamp is the ideal weapon of choice. At 74 Agility, or 69 with a summer pie boost, and with the hard Wilderness Diary completed, an Agility shortcut becomes available for quickly accessing the dragons and escaping an onslaught. You can use a waka canoe to travel to the Wilderness pond and run East to the shortcut, or a games necklace to teleport to the Corporeal Beast's lair, go north to the shortcut, kill some dragons, leave via the shortcut, go south into level 30 Wilderness, teleport to Edgeville with an amulet of glory, and repeat. You can also use a burning amulet to teleport to the Lava Maze, or Annakarl teleport and run southwest. Otherwise, you'll just have to traverse the deep Wilderness going to and from the Mage Arena bank, which is more dangerous and risky.",

This makes each kill worth  coins. An axe is needed to pass through the dungeon. The entry fee to the dungeon is 875, unless you have paid the  gp for permanent access. Fire and Nature runes can be brought for High Alch if needed\n\n\n\nEach trip will last about 20 minutes including banking hides and bones and returning to the dungeon. The best method of banking is to teleport to Edgeville using an Amulet of glory, and return to the dungeon via teleporting to your player-owned house in Brimhaven (requires 40 Construction) via House tab. Otherwise, banking in Mor Ul Rek and running to the dungeon will be very tedious and long. Another method is by using Karamja gloves 3 to teleport to Shilo Village, banking, and returning via the cart to Brimhaven.\n\nThose who've done the Elite diary can have access to a shortcut to the red dragons as well as noted red dragonhide.\n\n90-100 kills per hour should be expected with a dragon hunter lance due to less banking time, with more being possible with max stats and gear. Around 55,000 combat experience per hour and  -  gp per hour can be expected if paying moderate attention.\n\nPlayers who have completed Dragon Slayer II may prefer killing red dragons in the Myths' Guild basement, as they are much closer to a bank alongside ease of access with the mythical cape teleport.",

Your actual profits may be higher or lower depending on your speed.\n\nSkogres and zogres can be found in Jiggig during and after the Zogre Flesh Eaters quest, and they always drop the ogre coffin keys that are used to loot ogre coffins. Since the bones from the coffins are quite valuable, the keys are valuable and skogres/zogres can be very worthwhile to kill.\n\nThe undead ogres are located south of Castle Wars, in the main Jiggig area past the skull barrier. The easiest way to get here (and to bank) is by using a ring of dueling.\n\nThey are Combat level 44 and only have 71 Hitpoints, but there's a hitch; unless you're using the Ogre comp bow and brutal arrows (safespotting them behind the fire pit or coffins), your damage will be reduced by 80% of what it would normally be if you use ANY other weapon and ammunition. Using Melee is not recommended as the zogres/skogres have a long death animation, and it's worth it to kill one, walk over to it, attack another one from a distance, and pick up the key once it shows up.\n\nA good ranging method is killing one or two and running out and getting the drops, the coffin keys and zogre bones, and you'll also want to pick up any arrows you lost too. Bury the bones as soon as you get them, but try not to bury more than three or four at a time. In Jiggig, when you bury a bone (having crossed the barricade), then there's a chance that an aggressive Skogre will spawn.\n\nIt should only take 10-20 seconds to kill one even with the damage penalty, so a full inventory might take 8-10 minutes. Banking is very quick at Castle Wars. After you've finished, sell your keys on the Grand Exchange, but keep in mind that as ogre coffin keys have a low buying limit; you may be able to sell them in bulk for a higher price.\n\nAlternatively, you could loot coffins with the keys you have obtained (making sure not to use the same Coffin each time as it seems that you get more Ourg bones if you alternate between 2-3 coffins with each key used. This is more efficient since it saves banking time and can even be used between monster respawns. Note that this is a slow but effective money making method for low ranged and low combat players.",

Extended trips often result in the inability to pick up the hydra bones dropped from every kill. Despite this, extended trips typically lead to higher kills per hour, increasing profit over time.\n\nSee the Alchemical Hydra article and the strategy guide for additional information.",

Alternatively using a Burning Amulet to teleport to the Bandit Camp, and running north-west to the ruins is a viable option for those without Desert Treasure I completion. If you wish to take a detour, as to avoid player killers, you can teleport to the Corporeal Beast's lair via a games necklace, exit, and then run a bit south-east to the Wilderness Obelisk. Keep using the obelisk until you finally reach level 27 Wilderness where you'll run south-west towards the Western Ruins in circa level 22–24 Wilderness. \nAlthough he is within the teleport range in the Wilderness (up to level 30 Wilderness), you may get teleblocked. \n\nIt is also noteworthy, if using Iban Blast, to factor in the cost of death runes, as their price can significantly lower profits.\n\nNonetheless, the most effective way is to use Magic while activating Protect from Missiles and avoiding his special attack of explosive books. Get ready to run out of the area whenever he exclaims, \"Rain of knowledge!\" All in all, the crazy archaeologist is a relatively simple boss, but a simple mistake can cause some damage to you with his special attack.",

Your actual profits may be higher or lower depending on your speed and luck.\n\nZombie pirates are found in the Wilderness at the Chaos Temple (Wilderness). They reside in low level wilderness in multi-combat, constantly in combat with Elder chaos druids who will also attack the player. Due to the danger they pose, along with their ability to cast Teleport block, pray Protect from Magic at all times while in this area. You will occasionally kill elder chaos druids indirectly with your cannon.\n\nZombie pirates have a lucrative drop table, including alchables, runes, and blighted supplies. The notably drop Adamant seeds, Zombie pirate keys which can be used at the Zombie Pirate's Locker or sold to other players, and very rarely the Teleport anchoring scroll. They drop Larran's keys if on Zombie slayer task from Krystilia and have the rare chance of obtaining a Zombie champion scroll.\n\nA Venator bow works especially well in this area due to its low risk and ability to hit multiple targets. A Webweaver bow or Craw's bow will hit especially hard but comes with additional risk.\n\nDue to the dangerous nature of this area, it is not recommended to stay in the area for an extended trip. Rather, bring enough supplies for short trips and bank frequently, as a Burning amulet will bring you directly back. In the event of an attack by PKers, leave your cannon and run south. Running to the Wilderness Ditch is the safest bet as you will be unable to teleport.",

The goal entails picking up everything salvageable and finding crowded worlds to loot either by waiting for player killers to kill revenant killers or by tailgating (i.e. following PK'ers or a PK clan). Above all is always keeping minimal risk in the Wilderness, so players should consider only three (or four with Protect Item) items if any in addition to the necessary items: a bracelet of ethereum, burning amulet and ring of wealth. Since the former is always lost on death, all the bracelet needs is one ether to charge and maintain tolerance, and spare bracelets and a backup amulet are recommended to have in the bank. In the unfortunate scenario, all items could easily be replaced at minimum costs, such as a looting bag via the Bounty Hunter Shop, thugs or chaos druids in Edgeville Dungeon. \n\nAlthough this activity can be one of the most lucrative sources of income for all players who survive being intercepted and interrupted by player killers, it is more beneficial for low-level accounts who cannot kill revenants. As players using burning amulets will encounter green dragons, an anti-dragon shield is strongly recommended, especially for lower-level players.",

The fastest way to get to the Sawmill is through the Balloon transport system, which requires completion of Enlightened Journey and unlocking the two balloon transport system routes to Varrock and Castle Wars. Unlock both of those routes by going to Entrana with 10 willow logs, 10 yew logs, and one normal log to unlock one route, return to Entrana via that route, then unlock the other route.\n\nOnce you've unlocked the Varrock route, requiring 40 Firemaking, you can fly to the Varrock balloon, just steps away from the Sawmill, for one willow log. Each balloon transport system destination has a crate which may be used to store up to 100 logs of each kind. The logs may be brought noted to the crate for faster deposits. All the crates share the same inventory of logs.\n\nTo start, make sure you have deposited at least 78 willow logs in the storage crate. Begin at the Castle Wars lobby, and withdraw 27 oak logs and at least 6,750 coins. (If you are not using graceful, you can only carry 20 logs due to the weight restriction of the balloon.

Each dose of olive oil costs about 0.9% sanctity to convert; a 4-dose vial of olive oil will cost about 3.6% sanctity to convert into sacred oil. Additionally, players must have at least 10% sanctity in order to convert olive oil into sacred oil.\n\nApproximately 300-400 sacred oil can be produced per hour depending on Crafting level. A higher Crafting level, Flamtaer hammer, and Flamtaer bracelet all increase sanctity gained per minute.\n\nThe official world for Shades of Mort'ton is world 377. Bringing a tinderbox is optional when playing on this world since other players usually keep the fire altar lit. Bring the Flamtaer hammer and Flamtaer bag. Wear the Morytania legs 3 and a Flamtaer bracelet. Building supplies can be purchased at Razmire Builders Merchants then stored in a Flamtaer bag for inventory space. Fill the rest of your inventory with olive oil. Go to the temple and start repairing the walls until you have 95%+ sanctity. Convert all olive oil to sacred oil on the fire altar.

Grab a new bracelet if needed and refill your inventory with olive oil and run back to the temple.\n\nA combat level of at least 81 is strongly recommended to avoid being targeted by the loar shades whilst building the temple.\n\nSacred oil is a relatively low volume trade item.

Once enough ingredients are collected, prepare the potions either at a bank or a convenient location near a bank for quick banking and repeat the process.\n\nSanfew Serum (4) is typically in demand due to its utility, making this a viable money-making method, especially if you can streamline the collection and production processes.",

The easiest way to get there is by teleporting to Castle Wars with a ring of dueling and walking to the most northern cave entrance, marked on the map to the right. A skavid map and a light source are required to enter. One cave nightshade can be found there, and it will respawn every 30 to 60 seconds depending on the population of the world, resulting in about 70-75 an hour on an average populated world.\n\nCollectors can utilise the World Switcher to hop worlds, allowing them to collect nightshade faster. Pick up the nightshade on one world, and then hop to another. Pick up the cave nightshade there, and repeat by hopping worlds, cycling back to the original world when needed. If you hop too many worlds, you will be disconnected and have to wait around 3-4 minutes before logging in again.\n\nAfter collecting 26 cave nightshade, teleport back to Castle Wars, bank, and repeat.

Weapon poison(++) is often in high enough demand, but it's generally worth it to buy one first and sell for just below that price, as opposed to selling instantly.\n\nWhile collecting Nightshades players may consider farming the patch at Draynor Manor to collect them little faster.",

Players who want strictly gold should focus on mining it at the Crafting Guild Mine, Arzinian Mine, or North Brimhaven Mine once all requirements are met.

Free-to-play players banking at Falador east bank can make between 6 and 10 trips an hour depending on Mining level and efficiency.\n\nFor members who do not meet the Smithing requirement to complete Between a Rock... or are unable to complete the hard Falador tasks, the North Brimhaven Mine becomes the fastest location to mine gold ore. It is recommended to have at least 41 combat so that the multiple poison scorpions around the mine are not aggressive. This mine contains 10 gold rocks as well as a spawn for gold ore with a respawn time of 4 minutes 30 seconds. For players that have completed the Shilo Village Quest, banking can be accomplished by taking the cart east of the Brimhaven fruit tree patch to Shilo Village and banking or by chartering a ship at the northern dock to Catherby and banking. A Ring of charos (a) will reduce the cost of chartering ships by half. \n\nAt level 99 Mining, there is a 29% chance to mine an ore from a gold rock each mining cycle (3 ticks or 1.8 seconds), and the dragon pickaxe has a 12.5% chance to be 2 ticks. Assuming maximum efficiency, a dragon pickaxe, and banking at the Crafting Guild this translates to a maximum of approximately 590 gold ore per hour. Thus, the hourly profit maxes out at  coins.",

There are many locations to mine iron ore, but the Mining Guild features several advantages; a trio set of iron ore rocks that are extremely close to a deposit box, an invisible +7 boost to mining, a 50% reduced ore respawn timer (which means you never have downtime between ores respawning), and a 1/100 chance per iron ore to acquire Unidentified minerals. Unidentified minerals can be exchanged for increased profits, or for Mining gloves and their variants. Mining iron is the fastest way to acquire unidentified minerals in the game.\n\nOptimal rates are achieved by utilizing Varrock Armour 1 or higher. A Celestial ring provides more ore per hour, but not enough to cover the time spent acquiring stardust. Gems provide more profit than an iron ore, so therefore profit rates for the Mining guild are calculated for wearing a charged amulet of glory. \n\nThe primary alternative to the Mining Guild location for iron ore is the Trahaearn Mine. You will not get unidentified materials, but you will get crystal shards, which will be rewarded at a 1/127 chance for each ore acquired, including bonus ores from mining enhancers. This is crystal shards per hour on average (Varrock armour assumed). Each shard obtained can be worth as much as  coins; this may be enough to make the celestial ring worth using, since it increases ore yield by 10%, meaning using it will yield  extra crystal shards per hour. If you wish to mine here, intentionally not using the amulet of glory to increase the amount of actual ore per hour may result in more profit via more crystal shards as well. The overall profit in the Trahaearn mine per hour will be around  coins.\n\nThe Mining Guild is located in Falador and can be most easily accessed using a Skills necklace. The Trahaearn mine is located within Prifddinas and can be accessed with a (eternal) teleport crystal or via the spirit tree network after completing Song of the Elves.",

Having a scout, such as a noob account, can be used to assess the risks and find available rocks.\n\nIf you have a members account however, more locations will become available to you.

However, runite mining can be very competitive, even at the most remote locations. Players must hop worlds every time the ore is depleted, in search of fresh rocks, which respawn every 12 minutes.

    "details": "The profit rate assumes pay-dirts are excavated per hour by default. Other assumptions include that the player has 99 Mining and is wearing the prospector's outfit and has all upgrades to the mine purchased. For the expected profit rates at lower levels, see the table at the bottom of the guide.\n\nMotherlode Mine, located in the Falador Dwarven Mines, is a somewhat popular Mining training method as it is low effort, can yield good profit and 30,000-60,000 Mining experience per hour. \n\nBy mining pay-dirt and cleaning it in the machine located in the centre of the mine, players collect random ores from the sack. Depending on their mining level they  can obtain coal, gold, mithril , adamantite , and runite .\n\nRandomly, players can also receive golden nuggets that can be traded in for a prospector's outfit, which grants a 2.5% XP boost to Mining if the full set is worn. \n\nAt 57 Mining, which cannot be boosted, 100 nuggets can be spent to unlock permanent access the upper level which has veins with longer depletion timers. For another 50 nuggets, a chute can be unlocked to deposit pay dirt from the top floor instead of needing to use the ladder. For 200 nuggets the pay-dirt sack can be upgraded to hold 189 ore instead of 108 ore.\n\nA dragon pickaxe or crystal pickaxe are strongly recommended.\n\nUsing a charged Amulet of Glory and a gem bag only slightly raises the overall profit due to how receiving a gem works. However, due to the sack capacities being a multiple of 27, holding a gem bag (or hammer) has no negative effect on rates.\n\nA coal bag can be used to speed up the banking of the ores retrieved from the sack (best used with an upgraded sack).\n\nUpon completing the Elite Falador Achievement Diary, players will have an increased chance of receiving higher ores when cleaning pay-dirt, which will increase profit per hour.",

Members you have a 1/50 chance to obtain an easy clue scroll. The expected value of an easy clue scroll is roughly coins each. Most of the value of an easy clue scroll is driven by trimmed / gold trimmed bronze / iron / steel / black armour, cosmetic items, God pages and some very rare items such as the Gold-trimmed monk's robes and Team cape zero. At  you cannot fail pickpocketing H.A.M. Members if you have the Ardougne Hard Diary completed. Alternatively if you have  and are wearing the Thieving cape you cannot fail either. As one pickpocket takes 1.2 seconds, it should take a bit over a minute on average to obtain an easy clue scroll (including dropping junk items). With large amounts of teleports unlocked, an easy clue scroll can generally be completed in under 90 seconds if all easy STASH are filled.\n\nThe general strategy is to teleport to Draynor Village using an Amulet of glory, running to the hideout which takes roughly 40 seconds, obtaining a clue scroll through pickpocketing and completing the clue scroll, banking in Draynor village repeating the process. Players who do not meet the requirements to pickpocket H.A.M. Members without fail should wear a dodgy necklace and full H.A.M. robes to decrease the probability of being kicked out of the hideout when failing a pickpocket. Note that wearing H.A.M. robes might mean that you need to bank if you wish to equip graceful outfit while completing the clue scroll.\n\nFor maximum efficiency it is required to be on the Arceuus spellbook and use POH portals for regular teleports, with preferably an Ornate jewellery box and Ornate rejuvenation pool built besides having Spirit tree & fairy ring built in your house. It should be noted that these high level requirements are only required for grinding out the absolute maximum amount of easy clue scrolls per hour, and without these completing 15 easy clue scrolls is perfectly possible with the teleports on the standard spell book, teleportation jewellery and Xeric's talisman if you have the thieving requirement. Tick manipulation should also be used to open the H.A.M. trapdoor faster than intended, saving up to 60 seconds an hour at 18 clues per hour.\n\nAt 18 easy clue scrolls completed per hour an average profit of  coins can be expected,  coins at 15 scrolls per hour,  coins at 12 scrolls per hour, and  coins at 9 scrolls per hour. Unlike with medium clue scrolls, the rewards with real value are a lot more spread out in easy clues. The probability for an expensive rare item (team capes or monk robes) is roughly 1 in 500 and hence only contributes roughly 10k to the total value of an easy clue scroll.",

At  it is possible to achieve  successful pickpockets per hour resulting in an average profit of  per hour, seeing two teleport seeds roughly every  hours.\n\nPickpocketing elves in Prifddinas gives a chance of pickpocketing crystal shards and enhanced crystal teleport seeds. Roughly 5% of the pickpockets will yield a crystal shard and 1/1,024 chance for an enhanced crystal teleport seed. Wearing the full rogue equipment will double the amount of shards and teleport seeds obtained on a successful pickpocket.

As the movement of the elf is random, it can take some time for the elf to walk to the desired spot. Another option is for players to pickpocket Lindir located south of the player-owned house portal in Prifddinas, he will never leave his house. Mithrellas can be trapped behind the door of her house directly west of the player-owned house portal. The player can also make use of their ornate rejuvenation pool and the Redemption prayer for healing and extending thieving trips. \n\nPlayers should consider bringing a partner or using world 378, which is the unofficial thieving world. With multiple people it is possible to block the elf from moving resulting in more pickpockets per hour.",

A Farming level of 75 is now needed to gain the rates described in this guide.\n\n\nPickpocketing master farmers can yield good amounts of seeds for Farming. The real money-makers are Ranarr seeds, Snapdragon seeds, and Snape grass seeds (worth , , and , respectively). These seeds are very rare (appearing every 1/302, 1/2083, and 1/260 pickpockets, respectively) but make up % of the profit.\n\nIf on RuneLite, it's recommended to pickpocket Martin in Draynor due to being able to change the left click from talk to pickpocket by holding shift. Talking to him before pickpocketing will prevent him from moving. He will move if you walk outside of a small radius, and will not talk to you again until 20 minutes in-game have elapsed.\n\nIf on RuneLite, you can also talk to the master farmers outside of Varlamore to prevent them from moving. They are far from a bank but do not have a cooldown to talk to them.\n\nIf low on health, players can buy wines from Fortunato in Draynor Village, or steal some cake from the Baker's stall if pickpocketing in Ardougne. Otherwise, players will need to use conventional food to restore Hitpoints.\n\nWith  a player can access the north wing of the Farming Guild wherein a Master Farmer can be trapped within the three-tile area on the west side of the Celastrus tree patch. Once the farmer walks to the furthest southern tile, a player only has to move one tile north every four minutes or so to allow the Master Farmer to move and reset its 5-minute respawn timer. Avoid stepping on the black rabbit or another player as this will cause the farmer to no longer be trapped by your character.\n\nProfit varies enormously based on Thieving level, greatly improving after certain milestones. At  players can equip full Rogue equipment for guaranteed double loot, doubling profit. At  players can complete the Ardougne Diary (hard) for an additional 10% pickpocketing boost. It is not recommended to thieve Master farmers for profit at low levels as there are much better money making methods out there. Below are some experience and profit estimates at certain levels.",

At 84 Thieving, looting them provides one of the most lucrative sources of income for high-level thieves if they can avoid a possible onslaught from the patrolling Chaos Elemental and survive the always-looming threat of a player killer. As always, players should not take anything they are not prepared to lose when it comes to the Wilderness.\n\nAfter arriving, players should activate Protect from Melee and loot the chests since the rogues will become hostile after stealing from them. While looting, players need to keep an eye out for player killers and manoeuvre around the castle if in danger. Also, climbing the stairs and going up and down could help buy some time to log out.\n\nMake sure to complete the medium Wilderness Diary to receive the standard amount of loot per chest (100%). Until it is completed, you will receive 25% less loot. It is also strongly recommended to complete the hard Wilderness Diary to receive 25% extra loot (total 125%, compared to 75% with neither diary completed). Additionally, completing the hard Wilderness Diary allows the ability to choose your destination when using the Wilderness Obelisks, allowing more convenient access to the Rogues' Castle via the level 50 deep wilderness obelisk.",
