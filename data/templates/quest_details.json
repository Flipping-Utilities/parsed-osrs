It was last seen at the devastating end of the God Wars, when Zamorak, in a fit of rage, used it to reduce the land of Forinthry to the Wilderness we know today.\n\nAngered by Zamorak’s actions, Guthix rose from his age-long slumber and banished the gods. He hid the Stone of Jas far underground, where it could never disturb the balance again...\n\nBut while Guthix sleeps, nefarious forces have been gathering; the Mahjarrat. Shaped by war and deadly ritual, their plans for the Stone can only lead to catastrophe.\n\nFacing off against the Mahjarrat is nothing new for dedicated adventurers – at every turn, they seem to grow in power and wage war against the people of Gielinor.
